            <salute>Dear Lady Georgiana</salute>
         </opener>
         <p>I am truly obliged to you for your kind invitation, and would with pleasure accept it if I could. But I shall remain in Chester,<note>The Peels’ home in Royton, Denbighshire, was only 12 miles from Chester; Lady Georgiana had clearly offered CD hospitality. CD’s farewell reading at Chester, fixed for 29 Apr, had been announced in the <hi rend="italic">Chester Guardian</hi> on 17 April, but was cancelled on the 24th, along with the rest of the programme for 1869, after CD’s collapse at Preston, 22 Apr (see the <hi rend="italic">Chester Chronicle</hi>, 24 Apr, which reprinted in full the certificate from CD's doctor, Francis Carr Beard: see also <hi rend="italic">To</hi> Forster, 22 Apr 1869, n3, in Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 12, p. 340).</note> only a few hours: going there rapidly from London, and returning as rapidly to read again.<note>He read Doctor Marigold and the Trial from Pickwick in the Temperance Hall, Bolton, that night. In a warm review, the <hi rend="italic">Bolton Chronicle</hi>, 24 Apr 1869, commented that near the close CD's voice "appeared somewhat to fail him", and he abridged the Trial by omitting Serjeant Snubbin's speech.</note> I have not seen my own house since Christmas—shall not see it until Midsummer<note>From <note>Earl Russell’s out-of-town home in Richmond Park since 1847.</note> January, CD had been either on his reading tour or based at the <hi rend="italic">All the Year Round</hi> Office on brief returns to London.</note>— could not go to Pembroke Lodge6 at Easter—and have been almost incessantly “Reading” since last October, in all the points of the compass.<note>For a detailed listing of CD's public readings on his Farewell Tour see Malcolm Andrews, Charles Dickens and His Performing Selves (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2006), pp. 286-90.</note></p>

<p>It gives me real gratification to know that you were pleased with my few words of reference to Lord Russell at Liverpool.<note>On 10 April, at the Liverpool banquet in CD's honour, he remarked: "there is no man in England whom I respect more in his public capacity, whom I love more in his private capacity, or from whom I have received more remarkable proofs of his honour and love of literature than . . . Lord Russell" (<hi rend="italic">The Speeches of Charles Dickens</hi>, ed. K.J. Fielding [Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1960], pp. 388-9).</note> I never can say anywhere how highly I respect and esteem him. I beg to offer my compliments to Mr. Peel,<note>Archibald Peel (1828-1910), Lady Georgiana's husband (married 1867), and nephew of Sir Robert Peel (1788-1850; Prime Minister 1841-6).</note> and to thank him no less than yourself.</p>
