I think your Poem on Prince Albert’s Death,<note>Prince Albert had died on 14 Dec 61; CD postponed his readings for that week in Liverpool until 27-29 Jan 62. Ball’s poem has not been traced and was probably unpublished; a poem by Robert Lytton, “A Great Man”, was published in <hi rend="italic">All the Year Round</hi>, VI, p. 421 (25 Jan 62).</note> a production of very great merit – full of lofty feeling and expression, and quite apart from the common-places of such an occasion. It does you infinite credit, and I congratulate you upon it very cordially
