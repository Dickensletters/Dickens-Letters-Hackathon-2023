I am glad you were amused by the Paper<note>“A Plated Article”, <hi rend="italic">Household Words</hi>, 24 Apr 52, V, 117-21; written with Wills.</note> which my interesting visit to the Works<note>In early April, when visiting Birmingham and Shrewsbury with Wills.</note> over which you preside—and to the Dodo<note>CD’s name, in “A Plated Article”, for the Swan hotel, Stafford, “the extinct town-inn”.</note>—suggested. Mr. Wills had brought me such alarming reports of the indignation of the people of Stafford in behalf of their brick, and their town,<note>The article refers to the Town Hall as a “brick and mortar” private on parade and to Stafford as “dull and dead a town as any one could desire not to see”. <hi rend="italic">The Staffordshire Advertiser</hi>, 24 Apr, quoting “A Plated Article” (<hi rend="italic">Household Words</hi>, dated 24 Apr, was issued 21 Apr), defended the town against CD’s strictures.</note> that when I found myself, three weeks ago,<note>Presumably on 11 May, when the Guild company of actors was travelling from Shrewsbury to Birmingham.</note> obliged to wait at the Station there, three hours, I was not without personal apprehensions and a secret resolution never to be taken alive.</p>
