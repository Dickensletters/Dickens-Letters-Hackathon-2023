Since those remote times when I had the pleasure of passing some happy hours in your society, I have heard wild legends concerning you â€“ darkly shadowing forth the possibility of your entrance into the blessed state,<note>Fletcher married Harriet Eugenia (1815-89), daughter of Eugene Callanan of Lisbon, in 1845.</note> and furthermore of your presenting yourself in Italy, when I was there, a year ago. As you never came, I am induced to think you may possibly be in Edinburgh; and if so, allow me to present to you, one of my dearest and most valued friends, in the person of Mr. Macready. His name is not strange to you; nor will he be long, I think.
