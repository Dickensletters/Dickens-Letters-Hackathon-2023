My difficulty about Friday, is, that I am not sure when my Scotch friend<note>CD’s old friend John Thomson Gordon (1813-65), Sheriff of Midlothian, was staying with him at this time; see Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 7, p. 64 and n; also pp. 65, 71. For further information on Gordon see Paul Schlicke and William F Long, 'Dickens’s Second-Best Scottish Friend: John Thomson Gordon 1813-1865,' <hi rend="italic">Dickensian</hi> 111.3 (2015): 257- 64.</note> departs for Edinburgh, but I rather think he will not go until Saturday at the earliest. Therefore I am with-held from making any engagement, as we go wildly to theatres and other public places, and I am bound to keep within call – like a Surgeon. I think our only course is, to trust to our better fortune – Autumn – and India!  Or possibly you may find yourself at Boulogne in the course of the Summer, when I should be very happy to see you there. If I can get a good house, I purpose passing the whole summer in that place.
