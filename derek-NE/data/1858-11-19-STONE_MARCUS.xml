         <p>   You made an excellent sketch from a book of mine, which I received (and have preserved) with great pleasure.<note>Stone, then aged 12, had produced a sketch from <hi rend="italic">Bleak House</hi>, of Jo at the gates of the graveyard ("Marcus Stone: Early Life", p. 12)</note> Will you accept from me, in remembrance of it, this little book.<note>CD presented Stone with a copy of his <hi rend="italic">Child's History of England</hi>; the inscription reads: "Marcus Stone. From his friend | CHARLES DICKENS | Christmas 1858.</note> I believe it to be true, though it may be sometimes not as genteel as History has a habit of being.<note><hi rend="italic">The Child's History</hi> was published in <hi rend="italic">Household Words</hi> from 25 January 1851 to 10 December 1853, and in three volumes, 1852-1854. It was partial to the Protestant cause and sympathetic to Oliver Cromwell (who, CD believed, possessed "courage and high abilities"), while denigrating Popish plots and kings like James I, whom CD called "his Sowship" and described as "ugly, awkward, and shuffling both in mind and person". Henry VIII is described as "a most intolerable ruffian, a disgrace to human nature, and a blot of blood and grease upon the History of England."</note></p>
