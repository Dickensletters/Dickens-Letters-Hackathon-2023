I cannot tell you how grieved I am for poor dear Arthur<note>Arthur Smith (1825-61), manager for his brother Albert’s Egyptian Hall entertainments (1852-60); for CD’s Amateur Theatrical tour in aid of Douglas Jerrold’s family; and for CD’s Public Readings, 1856-61. Arthur had fallen ill with diphtheria while on a short visit to Paris.</note> (even you can hardly love him better than I do), or with what anxiety I shall wait for further news of him. Pray let me know how he is tomorrow. I go to Manchester, to speak, on Friday Morning;<note>CD was Chairman at the Prize-giving of the Institutional Association of Lancashire and Cheshire at Manchester, 3 Dec.</note> but shall be back in the night of Saturday. Let me find another word from you, too, when I return.

See <hi rend="italic">To</hi> Joseph Olliffe, 24 August 1856.</note> is the kindest and gentlest of men—a man of rare experience and opportunity—perfect master of his profession, and to be confidently and implicitly relied upon. There is no man alive, in whose hands I would more thankfully trust myself. I will write a cheery word to the dear fellow in the morning.<note><hi rend="italic">To</hi> Arthur Smith, 2 Dec 1858, in Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 8, p. 713.</note>
