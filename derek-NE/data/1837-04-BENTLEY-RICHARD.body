Wait till tomorrow. We shall put him out of sorts else, and retard the other.<note>Although not on mourning paper, the letter is possibly related to the negotiations in June 37 with the publisher Macrone over copyright of the <hi rend="italic">Sketches</hi> (Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 1, pp. 269-73); Forster, acting for CD, was also concerned about the terms under which CD was contracted to Bentley for two novels (<hi rend="italic">To</hi> Forster, ?9 June, ?14 June, ?15 June; Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 1, pp. 269-71). The days of the week for the two latter to Forster and this to Bentley (Wed, Thurs, Fri) would fit 14-16 June and CD may have been concerned on 16 June not to put Forster “out of sorts” by negotiations with Bentley and so “retard” the more immediately urgent negotiations with Macrone.</note>
