            <salute>Dear Mrs. Nichols</salute>
         </opener>
         <p>I am happy to retain Backwoods Life in Canada,<note>See To Mrs Nichols, 9 August 1864.</note> for insertion in A.Y.R. The enclosed I regret to say I cannot make available.<note> Untraced </note> If the case of your young charge<note>Presumably Mrs Nichols’s daughter, Mary Wilhelmina, who died later this year.</note> were mine, I would try either the neighbourhood of Dijon, or the neighbourhood of Marseilles.<note>The advice is odd: CD never visited Dijon, though he set Edith’s confrontation with Carker there (<hi rend="italic">Dombey</hi>, ch.54); at least, if Marseilles was “a dirty and disagreeable place”, the prospect of “the beautiful Mediterranean...is most delightful” (<hi rend="italic">Pictures from Italy</hi>, “Avignon to Genoa”). The “North wind” (below) is the Mistral, cold, dry, and violent, which sweeps down from the Alps.</note> I think I would give the preference to the latter, because of the beautiful sea. The precaution of not living in a situation exposed to the North wind, would be very necessary to observe in that country.And I would not live in Marseilles by any means, but somewhere in its vicinity. Mr. Wills will send you a cheque for Ben’s Beaver, The Unholy Land paper (which I have called “On the Mississippi”), and Backwoods,<note>“Backwoods Life in Canada” (<hi rend="italic">All the Year Round</hi>, 1 Oct; XII, 190); presumably the article referred to as “good and true” in <hi rend="italic">To</hi> Mrs Nichols, 9 August 1864.</note> all in one. I have begged him to do so, this very morning.</p>
<p>Looking back to your letter, I note your enquiry whether I think anything could be done in the way of French life, for A.Y.R. Without feeling able positively to answer No, I reply, I think not. I have at various odd times done a good deal of French life myself, and we have an old contributor to Household Words always resident in France,<note>Almost certainly Edmund Saul Dixon (1809-93); see Anne Lohrli, <hi rend="italic">Household Words</hi>, Toronto, 1973, pp. 256-61</note> who lays hold of french<note>CD wrote “french” with a small initial letter.
</note> subjects. Pray offer my kind regard to your good husband,<note>Dr Thomas Low Nichols (1815-1901; <hi rend="italic">Dictionary of American Biography</hi>), pioneer dietician, water-cure practitioner and social and sanitary reformer; second husband of Mary Nichols (married 1848).</note> with all good wishes for him and for you.</p>
