         </opener>
         <p>If you have room for me, I wish to stay at the Bedford from Friday morning the 12th to Sunday morning the 14th<note>Thus in MS (no full stop). CD gave three readings in the Town Hall, Brighton: the Carol on Friday evening, 12 Nov; <hi rend="italic">Little Dombey</hi> at 3 p.m., Saturday; and on Saturday evening, 13 Nov, <hi rend="italic">The Poor Traveller</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Boots at the Holly Tree Inn</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Mrs Gamp</hi>. <hi rend="italic">The Brighton Examiner</hi>, 17 Nov 1858, reported that his reception was "warm and friendly"; but the impulse to hear him perhaps "a little heightened by the notoriety of his transpiring domestic relations". It criticised his reading of <hi rend="italic">Little Dombey</hi>: "The great novelist is, we think not a great elocutionist . . . his voice, distinct and audible enough, is not of the kind that makes its way directly to the heart."</note> I want a sitting-room, and two bedrooms; one for myself, and one for my friend Mr Arthur Smith,<note> Arthur Smith (1825-61), manager for his brother Albert’s Egyptian Hall entertainments (1852-60); for CD’s Amateur Theatrical tour in aid of Douglas Jerrold’s family; and for CD’s Public Readings, 1856-61. Wilkie Collins joined the party on Saturday 13 Nov; see Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 8, p. 703.
</note> who manages the business of my readings. We shall be obliged to dine, on Friday, as early as 4 o'Clock.</p>
