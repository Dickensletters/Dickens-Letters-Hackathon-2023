I regret that I did not know in sufficient time to-day to write to you, that I could not have my usual pleasant hour with you in the morning. I find, however, that some matters of business connected with our removal from hence, call me from home so early, and will occupy me so long, that I have no alternative but to postpone our reading.<note>i.e. class or study session (as in “reading” a subject at University).</note> We have now two or three readings to make up, and I hope we shall soon be able to redeem them. My brother<note>Frederic Dickens (1820-68): see Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 1, p. 47n.</note> shall call on you before Wednesday with our new address. Meantime believe me
