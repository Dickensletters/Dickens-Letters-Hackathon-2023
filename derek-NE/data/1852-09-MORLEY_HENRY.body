 My impression that many of the Parisian Theatres are subsidized, is derived from my eye-sight remembrance of the length of their list, which is annually published in the French papers.<note>In Oct 1852, Morley published "The Theatres of Paris" (<hi rend="italic">Household Words</hi> 6 [2 Oct 1852]: 63-9), which focuses on the financial side of theatrical production in the French capital. It includes the observations that "There has been published in Paris, during the present year, the result of an elaborate inquiry into the statistics of the theatres", and that "the French Government...  is accustomed also to make compensatory presents to [theatres], and to help them out of difficulty by subventions" (pp. 63, 65).</note>
