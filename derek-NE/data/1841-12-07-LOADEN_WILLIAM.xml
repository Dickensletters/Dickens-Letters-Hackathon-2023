            <title><hi rend="italic">To</hi> WILLIAM LOADEN,<note>William Loaden (1800-63), solicitor, practising with his brother George at 28 Bedford Place, Russell Square. A friend of John Forster (who burnt "thousands" of Loaden's letters), and of Daniel Maclise, to whom he gave legal advice in Nov 50 (see To Daniel Maclise, 25 Dec 50, in Pilgrim Letters 6, p. 247, n 3). Eliza Lynn Linton recalled that Loaden, their family solicitor, and his brothers and sisters were her chief friends when she first came to London in 1845, and described him as a man of "sharp, brisk energy" and "absolute self-confidence" with "worldly knowledge and business capacity" (<hi rend="italic">My Literary Life</hi>, 1899, pp. 48-50).</note> 7 DECEMBER 1841 </title>

         <p>    I send you the draft Warrant of attorney,<note> Probably connected with arrangements for the American visit. In Oct, CD was going almost daily into the City about such business, particularly with regard to insurance, and was still finalising matters in Dec (To Thomas Mitton, 29 Oct; To Edward Marjoribanks, 11 Dec, Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 2, pp. 414, 442-3).
</note> in which I have made a very slight interlineation.</p>
