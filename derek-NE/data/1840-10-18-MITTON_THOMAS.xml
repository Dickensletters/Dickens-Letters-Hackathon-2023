            <title><hi rend="italic">To</hi> THOMAS MITTON,<note>Thomas Mitton (1812-78), solicitor, one of CD’s closest friends. Son of Thomas Mitton, publican, of Battle Bridge (the district now known as King's Cross), where the Mitton and Dickens families may at some time have been neighbours – perhaps in The Polygon, where the Dickenses were living 1827-8. In recollections given to the <hi rend="italic">Evening Times</hi> when she was 95, Mitton's sister Mary Ann claimed to have known CD well as a small girl. Mitton and CD were clerks together for a short time during 1828-9 in Charles Molloy's office, 8 New Square, Lincoln's Inn, where Mitton served his articles. He acted as CD’s solicitor for twenty years.</note> 18 OCTOBER [1840]</title>

         <p>    I am very sorry I had made an engagement last Monday evening, and could not very well break it. I shall most likely see you in the course of tomorrow; but if not, certainly on Tuesday morning.</p>
<p>I have the Clock<note><hi rend="italic">Master Humphrey's Clock</hi>, the weekly periodical edited by Dickens, and featuring <hi rend="italic">The Old Curiosity Shop</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Barnaby Rudge</hi>; published between 4 April 1840 and 4 December 1841.</note> account, and you shall see it. It is mortal long and complicated, but here is the result.</p>
<p>
Total Receipts	10,635.. 10.. 10
Total expenditure, including the cost of the stock of the value of £2,875.. 9.. 6 now on hand	10,295.. 4.. 10
Balance in money now in hand in favor of the partners<note>CD signed a formal agreement to undertake a new journal on 15 Oct 1839; the contract was signed on 31 March 1840. See Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 1, p. 681; 2, pp. 464-71. The terms were set to ensure that he could exercise editorial control over the work, and that the primary financial rewards accrued to him, rather than the publisher. This agreement established many of the features of Chapman and Hall's later semi-annual reports to Dickens. For further information, see Robert L. Patten, <hi rend="italic">Charles Dickens and His Publishers</hi> (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2017), pp. 82-4.</note> 	340.. 6.. 0

<p>So, you see all the profit is spent in stock,<note>CD had expected to make between £10,000 and £11,000 on the project; but high cost of the numerous woodcuts meant much smaller profits – some £1,068 for Dickens – on top of his stipend of £50 per part.</note> and this half year I'm half Master of God knows how many thousand reams of printed paper</p>
