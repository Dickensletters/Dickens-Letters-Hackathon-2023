It is with the greatest reluctance and regret, I assure you, that I resign the pleasure of dining with you to day. But I was seized upon, yesterday, by an unusually severe cold in the throat and chest, to which the consideration that I have to read tomorrow evening,<note><hi rend="italic">CD read the Christmas Carol and The Trial</hi> from Pickwick at St Martin’s Hall: one of two readings added to his London Christmas reading programme. On the Thursday, CD wrote to Wilkie Collins, “You have no idea what a cold I have! How I am to read tonight, I don’t know” (Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 9, p. 24).</note> forces me to attach more importance than I should otherwise bestow upon it. After arguing the matter with myself, with a prolixity worthy of Westminster Hall,<note>Part of the Palace of Westminster, used from medieval times as a law court; proverbial for legal wordiness. The bachelor lawyer in CD’s “The Ghost of Art” (<hi rend="italic">Household Words</hi>, 20 July 50, I, 385) characterizes it as having “too much talk and too much law”: see also Bleak House, ch. 24.</note> I am driven to the conclusion that I must get to bed at about your dinner-hour, and be mustard-poulticed and messed and made wretched in a variety of ways. If I went out tonight, I could have no reasonable hope of being fit for tomorrow.
