As we have now two serial stories<note><hi rend="italic">At the Bar</hi> by Charles Collins and <hi rend="italic">Half a Million of Money</hi> by Amelia B. Edwards.</note> publishing in these pages together, I wish to give each of your papers a separate name, so that each may seem, for the time being, complete.<note>CD later noted that the public have a tendency, “having more than two serial stories to bear in mind at one time, to jumble them all together, and do justice to none of them” (Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 12, p. 443). Eastwick’s papers on Venezuela, where he had been Commissioner for arranging Venezuela loans 1864 and 1867, appeared in All the Year Round, 4 Nov 65 – 28 Apr 66, XIV, 343 – XV, 366. There is no reference to the individual papers being part of a series. The <hi rend="italic">All the Year Round</hi> volume indexes, though, give not only the specific titles, but also a general title, “Venezuela”, as well as alternative titles: e.g. “Erminia”, <hi rend="italic">All the Year Round</hi>, 28 Apr 66, XV, 366, is indexed also under “Venezuela” and “Valencia, The Beauties of”.</note> Will you let me know what title you would prefer for your first chapter,<note>“To Venezuela: Sailing on a Friday”, <hi rend="italic">All the Year Round</hi>, 4 Nov 65, XIV, 343.</note> and will you let me have some more Manuscript to send to the Printer? It is unnecessary to remark, perhaps, that when you collect your papers, you can either use these separate headings as titles of chapters, or abolish them altogether.<note>Eastwick’s Venezuela: or, <hi rend="italic">Sketches of Life in a South American Republic; with a History of the Loan of 1864</hi> (1868), retains the <hi rend="italic">All the Year Round</hi> headings with minor variations and additions.</note>
