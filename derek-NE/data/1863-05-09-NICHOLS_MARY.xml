            <title> <hi rend="italic">To</hi> MARY NICHOLS,<note>Mrs Mary Sargeant Neal Gove Nichols (1810-84; <hi rend="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</hi>), American miscellaneous writer, reformer and water-cure practitioner; advocated mesmerism, temperance and dress reform. On becoming a Quaker, married Hiram Gove (1832); met Thomas Low Nichols, 1848 (see Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 10, p. 385n; 21 Apr 1864) and after a legal separation from Gove, she and Nichols “lived and worked together” (T. L. Nichols, Nichols’ <hi rend="italic">Health Manual</hi>, 1887, p. 90), having gone through a Swedenborgian ceremony (July 1848). The Nicholses became Spiritualists, then, ordered by the spirits, Roman Catholics (Nichols, ibid., p. 97). The Nicholses left America on the outbreak of the Civil War (Apr 1861), settling first in London and then (1867-72) in Great Malvern. See further Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 10, p. 243n.</note> 9 MAY 1863</title>

         <p>I beg to thank you for the opportunity you have given me of reading your paper on myself,<note> Untraced </note> and for the sincere gratification I have derived from its perusal. I am perfectly sure that it is what you tell me it is—“a heart tribute”—and I assure you from my own heart that I deeply feel and esteem it.</p>
<p>In Mr. Wills’s<note>William Henry Wills (1810-80; <hi rend="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</hi>), later CD's personal secretary, one of his most trusted friends, and assistant editor of <hi rend="italic">Household Words</hi> and <hi rend="italic">All the Year Round</hi>.</note> feeling that there would be a kind of impropriety in its appearing in pages under my direction,<note>I.e. in <hi rend="italic">All the Year Round</hi>.</note> I quite concur. If I thought less highly of your praise, I might have less delicacy on this head.
</p>
<p>Will you allow me to enclose you a card, which will admit you on any or all of the five Fridays on which I shall read this season.<note>15, 22, 29 May; 5, 12 June.</note> I send you with it my grateful interest and regard.</p>
