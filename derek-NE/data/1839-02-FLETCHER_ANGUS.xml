         <p>We find that to be dutiful and relation-like we must alter our plans, and ask divers aunts and uncles to dine with us to-day at 6. Will you alter your plan of coming in the evening, and dine with us too?</p>
<p>A most mean signature, but I am writing under the soothing influence of Mr. Pickering,<note>Ferdinand Pickering, of 14 High Street, Camden Town, Active 1831-82; exhibited at the Royal Academy and elsewhere; painted mainly genre, literary, and historical subjects. His name and address noted in CD’s Diary, 10 Mar 38; sittings presumably began about then. The portrait (the “practical joke against me”) still in progress, 4 Jan 39 (To Forster, Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 1, p. 491), and an appointment again noted in CD’s Diary, 21 Feb 39. No portrait of CD by him is known to exist.</note> the author of that meek portrait still unfinished. A word in reply. Apropos. Kate<note>Catherine Dickens (1815-79), CD's wife.</note> wants her picture<note>Not identified. Fletcher may have intended a companion bust of Kate to CD’s, using in part a sketch by himself or, possibly, an existing portrait. Samuel Laurence finished Kate’s portrait in Aug 1838 (Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 1, p. 395 n.3) and Fletcher might even be working from that.</note> (only for the day) if you can send it by bearer.  </p>
