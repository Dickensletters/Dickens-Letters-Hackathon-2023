I write briefly,<note>Clearly about a case for Urania Cottage, the home for homeless women established by CD. CD had urged Broderip to recommend cases (26 July 50, Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 6, p. 136) and presumably refers to Sarah Youngman's admission (To Broderip, 25 May 52, Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 6, p. 683).</note> being surrounded at this moment (in the spirit) with no end of brickmakers’ babies and forms of phantoms all calling out of the gloom, ‘Take me next,’ ‘Look at me,’ ‘It’s my [turn],’<note>Source reads “time”. CD was at work on <hi rend="italic">Bleak House</hi>, No. 4 (chs 11-13); he refers to ch. 8, the brickmaker’s house and the death of Jenny’s child. The plan for No. 4 shows he thought of developing this line, then rejected it for the present: “The Brickmaker’s Family? No”.</note>…
