I am very happy to have the pleasance of accepting your picturesque remembrances of Warsaw. The two papers will go best (I think) rolled into one.<note>Published as ‘When Order Reigned in Warsaw’, <hi rend="italic">All the Year Round</hi> 10 (5 September 1863): 31-5.</note> You shall have a proof sent to you in that form, a few days hence.
