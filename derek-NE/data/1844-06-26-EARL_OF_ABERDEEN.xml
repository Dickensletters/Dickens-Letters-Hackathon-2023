         <p>As I am on the eve of leaving England on a visit to France and Italy,<note>CD and his family travelled and lived on the Continent from July 1844 to July 1846.</note> I beg to make application to Your Lordship for a Foreign office Passport; including myself, my family,<note>CD was accompanied by his wife Catherine, and their children Charley, Mamie, Katey, Walter, and Frank.</note> and servants.<note>CD mentions two nurses in ch. 1 of <hi rend="italic">Pictures from Italy</hi>: Anne Brown, and Charlotte Stubbing. Stubbing remained in Genoa and married William Johnson, a servant of Sir George Craufurd, 3rd Baronet of Kilbernie (see <hi rend="italic">To</hi> Bradbury &amp; Evans, 7 July 1845, Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 4, pp. 326-27). In addition, the Dickens family brought a cook, Jane, who married a Frenchman, the cook of the British Consul at Genoa, Timothy Yeats Brown; Jane remained in Italy (see To Daniel Maclise, 9 May 1845, Pilgrim Letters 4, p. 306-307). CD employed Louis Roche, a native of Avignon, to act as a guide and make travel arrangements (described in <hi rend="italic">Pictures from Italy</hi> as "a French Courier – best of servants and most beaming of men!").</note></p>
