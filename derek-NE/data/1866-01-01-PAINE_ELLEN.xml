         <p>Either I have miswritten, or you have misread, a word in my letter. I had no such word as “safely” in my thoughts. I am much mistaken if I did not write “hopefully or usefully.” That opinion I retain. You may clear your mind of any suspicions that I am connected in any way with what you call 'The Stephenson party.’<note>A reference to the supporters of George Stephenson (1781-1848) and his son Robert (1803-59), railway engineers. They competed against other firms for the building of railway lines. See CD’s comments to Bulwer Lytton on railways and on the President of the Board of Trade, Thomas Milner Gibson, who had been severely criticised in Charles Tennant’s anonymously published pamphlet, Railways: In a Letter to the Right Honourable the President of the Board of Trade: A Plan for the Systematic Reform of the Railways of the United Kingdom by Legislative Enactment, 1865 (To Edward Bulwer Lytton, 6 July 1865, Pilgrim Letters 11, p. 68). The comments followed a bad accident at Rednal, near Shrewsbury, on 7 June 1865, and the Staplehurst railway accident, 9 June 1865, in which CD and his lover Ellen Ternan were involved. A long letter in The Times, 12 June 1865, by 'R.A.M.', a fellow-passenger of CD's on that Folkestone to London train, strongly criticised the 'human suffering consequent on railway mismanagement'.</note>
