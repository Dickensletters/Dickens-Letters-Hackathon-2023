Many thanks for your note, received here this morning. I wish the book were Lady Gordon’s!<note>Lady Duff Gordon, <hi rend="italic">née</hi> Lucie [Lucy] Austin (1821-69; <hi rend="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</hi>), author and translator. Married Duff Gordon, 1840: see further Pilgrim Letters 5, p. 44n and Supplement IX, <hi rend="italic">Dickensian</hi> (104), Summer 2008, p. 146n.</note> But I am afraid that a translation from M. De Wailly<note>Armand François Léon DeWailly; novelist, and translator from English: see Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 8, p. 508n.</note>—of a book appearing in a serial form in Paris—would not do for Household Words.<note>Lady Duff Gordon had translated an earlier novel of De Wailly’s (<hi rend="italic">Stella and Vanessa: A Romance</hi>, 1850); no later translation by her of De Wailly appeared.</note>
