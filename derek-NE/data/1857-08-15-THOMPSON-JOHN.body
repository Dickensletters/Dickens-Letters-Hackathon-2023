I am particularly anxious, John, that Mr.Austin<note>Henry Austin (?1812-61), architect and civil engineer; married Letitia Dickens 1837. See Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 1, p. 21n.</note> should have the enclosed letter<note>To Henry Austin, 15 Aug. The water supply at Gad’s Hill was a constant problem: in June the well ran dry and though now CD wrote to Austin that “we have got a famous spring”, the well needed to be dug 217 ft deep and the water was raised by a horse-driven pump (Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 8, p. 411, n.1).</note> to night or early tomorrow morning. It relates to the well here. We have found at last a great spring of water. I want you to take the letter down to him. Go to Ealing by the Railroad, and you will find his house about half a mile from the station. If you find him at home and get an answer, send it, or bring it, down here, any time tomorrow (Sunday.)
