I do not make the appointment you request, simply because I am unwilling to give you the trouble of coming here to no purpose. I assure you that I have not the slightest prospect of being able to visit Hull, during the next two years. All the engagements I could possibly make, to read for any Literary Societies, I made for next Christmas, six months ago. I am now on the verge of a new book,<note>CD had been planning and working on <hi rend="italic">Little Dorrit</hi> since early 1855: see <hi rend="italic">To</hi> Miss Coutts, 6 Feb, and <hi rend="italic">To</hi> Collins, 4 Mar (Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 7, pp. 525, 555 &amp; n).</note> and am quite unable to contemplate any additional occupation.<note>CD gave public readings in Hull, 14 Sep, 26 &amp; 27 Oct 58 (Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 8, pp. 752- 753).</note>
