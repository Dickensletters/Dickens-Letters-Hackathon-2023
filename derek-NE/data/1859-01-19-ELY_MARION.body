 I assure you with utmost truthfulness and heartiness, that the love of our old times is strong within me, and that I never see your handwriting – far less, yourself – without a genuine interest and affection. I would have gladly come tonight if it had been possible; but (as the girls<note>CD's daughters Mamie (1838-96) and Katey (1839-1929).</note> will tell you), I am doubly engaged, and have been so, a long long while.
