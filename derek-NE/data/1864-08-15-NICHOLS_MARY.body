I am happy to retain Backwoods Life in Canada,<note>See To Mrs Nichols, 9 August 1864.</note> for insertion in A.Y.R. The enclosed I regret to say I cannot make available.<note> Untraced </note> If the case of your young charge<note>Presumably Mrs Nichols’s daughter, Mary Wilhelmina, who died later this year.</note> were mine, I would try either the neighbourhood of Dijon, or the neighbourhood of Marseilles.<note>The advice is odd: CD never visited Dijon, though he set Edith’s confrontation with Carker there (<hi rend="italic">Dombey</hi>, ch.54); at least, if Marseilles was “a dirty and disagreeable place”, the prospect of “the beautiful Mediterranean...is most delightful” (<hi rend="italic">Pictures from Italy</hi>, “Avignon to Genoa”). The “North wind” (below) is the Mistral, cold, dry, and violent, which sweeps down from the Alps.</note> I think I would give the preference to the latter, because of the beautiful sea. The precaution of not living in a situation exposed to the North wind, would be very necessary to observe in that country.And I would not live in Marseilles by any means, but somewhere in its vicinity. Mr. Wills will send you a cheque for Ben’s Beaver, The Unholy Land paper (which I have called “On the Mississippi”), and Backwoods,<note>“Backwoods Life in Canada” (<hi rend="italic">All the Year Round</hi>, 1 Oct; XII, 190); presumably the article referred to as “good and true” in <hi rend="italic">To</hi> Mrs Nichols, 9 August 1864.</note> all in one. I have begged him to do so, this very morning.
