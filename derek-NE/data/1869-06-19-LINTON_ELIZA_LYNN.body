Although your article on our old friend is interesting as a piece of personal remembrance, it does not satisfy my desires as a review of Forster’s book.<note>John Forster’s <hi rend="italic">W. S. Landor: a Biography</hi>, pubd June 69: see Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 12, p. 352 and n. CD had asked Mrs Lynn Linton to write a review for <hi rend="italic">All the Year Round</hi>, no doubt because he knew she was a very old friend of Landor’s. For CD's return of the unpublished review see <hi rend="italic">To</hi> Eliza Lynn Linton, 21 June 1869.</note> It could hardly be otherwise than painful to Forster that I, one of his oldest literary friends, and certainly of all others his most intimate and confidential, should insert in these pages an account of Landor – or touch the subject – without a word of commendation of a biography that has cost, to my knowledge, a world of care and trouble. I find from your letter to my son that you do not think well of the said book. Admitting that the life was to be written at all, I do. And it is because I think well of it, and wish highly to commend it on what I deem to be its deserts, that I am staggered and stopped short by your paper,<note>According to G.S. Layard in his <hi rend="italic">Life</hi> (see above), the article she wrote began with the words: “The Life of Walter Savage Landor has yet to be written”.</note> and fear that I must turn to and write another in its stead.<note>CD wrote a review himself, recommending Forster’s book and describing Landor himself with affection and understanding; it appeared in <hi rend="italic">All the Year Round</hi>, N.S. Vol II, No. 34, 24 July 1869: see “‘The Uncommercial Traveller’ and Other Papers”, ed. Michael Slater and John Drew (<hi rend="italic">Dickens’ Journalism</hi>, 2000, Vol. 4, pp. 396-403).</note>
