I hear from Captain Buckley of the <hi rend="italic">Pylades</hi><note>Sydney Smith Dickens (below) served on the Pylades 1867-68; he joined the Zealous 1868.</note> that he has recommended my son<note>Sydney Smith Dickens (1847-72), CDâ€™s seventh child and fifth son. Entered the Royal Navy, Sep 1860, and trained on board the <hi rend="italic">Britannia</hi> at Portsmouth (Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 9, pp. 309, 316 &amp; nn). Midshipman, Dec 1861 (Pilgrim Letters 9, pp. 542 &amp; n, 543) and appointed to the Orlando, Dec 1861. Served on the <hi rend="italic">Pelican</hi>, June 1864-67, joining the Pylades, July 1867, where he advanced to Acting Sub-Lt (Aug 1867) and Sub- Lt (Nov 1867).</note> for promotion to a Death-vacancy<note>Though Buckley presumably wanted to promote him, Sydney joined the Zealous as Sub-Lt, Aug 1868.</note> on board his ship. He is kind enough to tell me that he has done so, because my son knows his profession well, and is a zealous and bright officer. If you can serve him again,<note>As Dacre had done in some way (Apr 1867), when Sydney was sent home on sick leave, having contracted African Coast fever (Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 11, pp. 352, 367).</note> I hope he will always do credit to your favorable remembrance.
