My impression of the Household Words transaction was, throughout, simply this:<note>or CD’s break with Bradbury &amp; Evans, the termination of <hi rend="italic">Household Words</hi>, and initiation of <hi rend="italic">All the Year Round</hi>, see Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 8 (including Appendix J) and 9 (including Appendix B) and Robert L. Patten, <hi rend="italic">CD and His Publishers</hi>, 1978, chs 13, pp. 260-3, and 14, pp. 267-9.</note> That I terminated a partnership which I had the right of terminating, because I could not have any thing more to do with Bradbury and Evans. That I took Wills from the first, into my confidence as to this intention, because I meant, in a new periodical, to replace him in his old position – greatly improved by the new periodical being freed from the incubus of Bradbury and Evans’s charges, and Bradbury and Evans’s conduct of the business, absolutely without control. That I gave to the destroyed publication, an adventitious value, for the sake of the new publication. That the destroyed one was absolutely worthless but for me. That I ran up its price and made it valuable, in the interests of the new publication. That the purchase of it was my act solely, and was of immense advantage to the new publication of which I gave<note>Written above “had given” deleted.</note> Wills a fourth share.
