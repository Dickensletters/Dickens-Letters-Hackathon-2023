I beg to assure you that I am truly sensible of the kindness and courtesy of your letter received to-night, and that I thank you for it cordially. It will be a great comfort to me to avail myself of your most obliging offer<note>Mason, after attending a reading (presumably that of 11 Dec), arranged for a saloon carriage to be brought from King’s Cross for CD’s return to London, as more “convenient for sleeping in” than those available in Edinburgh: see <hi rend="italic">To</hi> Hogarth, 18 Dec 68, Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 12, p. 251.</note> next Saturday night, by the 10 p.m. Train from here to King’s Cross.
