            <title><hi rend="italic">To</hi> EDWARD CRAVEN HAWTREY,<note>Edward Craven Hawtrey (1789-1862; <hi rend="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</hi>), Headmaster of Eton 1834-53. Educated at Eton and King's College, Cambridge (Fellow 1810-35). DD 1834. Assistant master at Eton 1814-34; Provost 1853-62. As Headmaster nearly doubled the school's numbers. Edited Goethe's lyrical poems 1833-4; published a translation of Homer into English hexameters 1843, and other translations of Greek, Italian and German verse. An easy-going bachelor, he had "an odd weakness for fine clothes, perfumes, and gold chains; one of the school beliefs was that 'Hawtrey stood up in Â£700' " (Arthur Duke Coleridge, <hi rend="italic">Eton in the Forties</hi> [London: R. Bentley &amp; Sons, 1896], p. 294). On one occasion he ordered a boy caught reading <hi rend="italic">Bleak House</hi> in class to translate Jo's evidence (Ch. 11) into Greek comic iambics (Francis St. John Thackeray, <hi rend="italic">Memoir of E. C. Hawtrey</hi> [London: George Bell &amp;amp; Sons,1896] p. 155n). CD's son Charley (1837-96) attended Eton from January 1850 to December 1852.</note> 1 JULY 1852</title>

         <p> I am most singularly unfortunate with you. On Saturday, I have a semi-public engagement which is associated with a very important design;<note>On Saturday 3 July CD had dinner with the architect Coutts Stone (1819-1902); see <hi rend="italic">To</hi> Angela Burdett Coutts, 30 June 1852, in Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 6, p. 702. Stone was working with CD's brother-in-law Henry Austin on the plans for Miss Coutts's project for improved sanitation in 150 tenement houses in Westminster; see To Angela Burdett Coutts, 3 Dec 1852, in Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 6, pp. 812-14.</note>  and for Tuesday, I have been engaged this fortnight!<note>CD was in Folkestone on Tuesday 6 July.</note> Nevertheless, I shall still hope that when the Fates have had enough of keeping us asunder, we shall meet.</p>
