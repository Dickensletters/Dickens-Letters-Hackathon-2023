         <p>Mr Charles Dickens presents his compliments to Doctor Thomson, and begs to recommend to him Mr Alfred Collinson,<note> Alfred Collinson (1815-72); obtained licence from the Society of Apothecaries 1839; MRCS 1842; MD Aberdeen 1856.
</note> a young gentleman who is a candidate for the situation of apothecary to the Holloway and North London Dispensary.<note>The Holloway and North Islington Dispensary, founded as a charitable dispensary in 1821; new premises opened 1840 in Francis Place, Holloway. CD naming is inaccurate.</note> Mr Dickens owes a great many apologies to Dr Thomson for giving him this trouble, but as he is interested in Mr Collinson's success,<note>It is not known whether Collinson was appointed.</note> and is quite sure that the gentlemen with whom the choice rests have no wishes but to appoint a deserving and clever young man, he ventures to hope that Dr Thomson will excuse him.</p>
