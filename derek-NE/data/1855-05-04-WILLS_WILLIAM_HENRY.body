I omitted two points yesterday. First, will you remind Morley at any odd time, of the History of the Sappers and Miners by the Quartermaster Sergeant.<note>See <hi rend="italic">To</hi> T.W.J. Connolly, 14 Apr 55.</note> Secondly, will you specially ask him if he will try to do any little fanciful thing in reference to the accompanying book of Leigh Hunt’s,<note>James Henry Leigh Hunt (1784-1859; <hi rend="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</hi>), essayist, critic and poet: see Pilgrim Letters 1, p. 341n and later vols. The original of Skimpole in <hi rend="italic">Bleak House</hi>: see Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 4, pp. 623 & n, 628 & n, Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 7, p. 460 & <hi rend="italic">nn</hi>. Stories in Verse, a gathering of verse tales, was published 30 Apr</note> that may do it a service? I am anxious about this, for reasons.<note>CD may have wanted to make some reparation for his portrayal of Hunt as Skimpole.</note> As it is a sort of Railway book, he might perhaps, under some such title as an extraordinary Railway Ride, describe the chief things in it as circling about him during a Railway journey and changing an ugly ride (say, along the fenny Eastern Counties for instance) into something sunny and beautiful.<note>Henry Morley’s “By Rail to Parnassus”, <hi rend="italic">Household Words</hi>, 16 June 55, XI, 477, takes the form of an account by a poor clerk of the diversion Hunt’s book provides on a train from Waterloo to Southampton (it was issued by Routledge in their Railway Library).</note> Don’t lose time about this, for I believe Hunt’s race on this side of the Moon to be nearly ended.<note>I.e. “his earthly life is nearly over”: although he survived until 1859, Hunt described himself in a letter, Feb 55, as “a bundle of clothes sitting by a fire”: see Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 7, p. 609, <hi rend="italic">n</hi>.6.</note>
