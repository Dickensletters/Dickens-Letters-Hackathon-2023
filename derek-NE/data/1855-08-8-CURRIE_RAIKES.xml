The trip to Boulogne, by ferry from Folkestone, must have been brief, most probably on 5 or 7 Aug: possibly connected with Gibson’s school there, where Alfred, Frank and Sydney Smith Dickens were due to start the school year on 1 Sep.</note> or I should have sooner acknowledged the receipt of your kind note. Our having some friends on a visit here,<note>As CD indicates in To Currie, 10 and 28 Aug, again refusing Currie’s invitations (see next and Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 7, p. 696), many friends stayed briefly; the certain visitor at this date is Wilkie Collins, who stayed throughout August.</note> prevents us from enjoying the pleasure it proposes to us.<note>Possibly a dinner invitation.</note> Mrs. Dickens<note>Catherine Dickens (1815-79), CD's wife.</note> begs me to thank Mrs. Raikes Currie on her behalf, through you.
