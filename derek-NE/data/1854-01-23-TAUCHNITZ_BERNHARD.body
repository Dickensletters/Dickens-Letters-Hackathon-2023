I received by Charley<note>Charles Culliford Boz Dickens ("Charley", 1837-96), CD's eldest son.</note> when he came home for his christmas holidays, a letter from Dr Müller<note>Professor O. C. Müller, 6 Tauchaer Strasse, Leipzig, a schoolmaster with whom Charley Dickens lived for six months in 1853, in order to learn German. See To Angela Burdett Coutts, 1 Apr 1853, Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 7, p. 56. See also To Tauchnitz, 2 Apr 1853.</note> of a nature very honorable to the Doctor's<note>"his" deleted; "the Doctor's" written above caret.</note> forethought and truthfulness, asking me to consider what I thought would be best for Charley's<note>"Charley's" written over "his".</note> future disposal. I have written him by this same post, a letter in reply which I fear you will have the trouble of explaining to him, and which I therefore will not repeat here. But I think and hope you will agree with me that my reasons, therein briefly stated, for proposing to leave Charley at Leipzig only another six months, are sound and judicious.<note>CD wrote to Angela Burdett Coutts on 18 Jan 1854, to say that he and Charley had “had a little talk together” about sending him to Germany as an "inducement to application," so that he could return home "to begin life" (Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 7, pp. 252-3). On Charley’s progress see Dietmar Böhnke, “The Lost Leipzig Letters: Charles Dickens,Bernhard Tauchnitz and the German Connection”, in Stefan Welz and Elmar Schenkel (eds.), <hi rend="italic">Dickens on the Move: Travels and Transformations, Charles Dickens Bicentenary, Conference 2012</hi>, Leipzig, Frankfurt am Main, Peter Lang, 2014, pp. 162-4. See also Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 7, 478n: “Tangible results of Charley’s education were three plays edited for English students of German.” In the event, Charley stayed until December 1854, as is clear from CD’s letter to Arthur Ryland of 6 Dec 1854, asking about business openings in Birmingham: “My eldest boy, now 18, comes home from Leipzig tomorrow. He wishes to enter mercantile life, and I am casting about for the best opening for him. He has been educated at Eton, has lived two years in Germany, and his name is my name, and he is an accomplished and creditable fellow” (Pilgrim Letters 7, p. 478)</note>
