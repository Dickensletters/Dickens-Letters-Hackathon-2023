I have been much inconvenienced and pained this last week by a neuralgic attack in the foot to which I am sometimes liable, and which originally came of over walking in deep snow.<note>In Feb 65; see Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 11, pp. 18-19, and also, <hi rend="italic">To</hi> Mrs Ross Church, 6 Aug 67, for a similar attack.</note> The moment I can stand after such a seizure (which in the present case is this moment of writing), I have recourse to change of air. But I shall be back here on Sunday, and happy to receive a call from you on that day between 2 and 3, if that should suit your convenience.
