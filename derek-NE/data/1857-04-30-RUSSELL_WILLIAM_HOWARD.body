If you should be disengaged for Saturday Week the 9th of May, it would give Mrs Dickens and myself very great pleasure, if you would dine with us that day (a very small party) at half past six punctually. I should be happy to have so good an opportunity of heartily drinking success to the campaign before you.<note>CD was helping Russell to prepare his lectures on the Crimean war; see Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 8, pp. 337, 763-4.</note><p>William H Russell Esquire.</p>
