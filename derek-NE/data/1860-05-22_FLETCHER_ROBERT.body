I am obliged to you for your letter, but I beg to assure you that a Poem of 1100 lines<note>Untraced.</note> is quite apart from the scope and limits of this Journal. And therefore, and because it is one of the rules of my life (enforced by its occupations) to give no opinion on Manuscripts that I have no chance of helping towards publication, I must reluctantly decline your proposal. The little poem I enclose opens very prettily, I think, but is something beyond the present range of its interesting writer.<note> Unidentified </note>
