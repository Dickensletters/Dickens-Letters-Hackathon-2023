I shall be happy to take charge of the Ten Guineas so kindly and feelingly subscribed for Mrs Hughes,<note>Jane Ann Hughes (1818-77), left destitute on the death of her husband, the Rev. Stephen Roose Hughes (1814-62), Rector of Llaneugrad with Llanallgo, Anglesey. CD was aware of her plight; see To John Page Hopps, 7 March 1862, Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 10, p. 45. CD had met the rector and his wife on a visit to Wales, in the wake of the wreck of the Royal Charter on 26 October 1859; the victims included Robert and Peter Hogarth, the sons of Robert Hogarth, of Scremerston, near Berwick, younger brother of CD's father-in-law. CD stayed at Hughesâ€™s rectory on 30 Dec 1859, and subsequently wrote an essay concerning the shipwreck for the opening instalment of 'The Uncommercial Traveller' (<hi rend="italic">All the Year Round</hi> 2, 28 Jan 1860: 321-6); he sent a draft to Hughes (who had buried 145 victims) for the correction of details. Jane Hughes had helped to identify the bodies. See To Roose Hughes, 10 Jan 1860, Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 9, pp. 196-7.</note> if you will have the goodness to forward that sum to me here, as may best suit your convenience.
