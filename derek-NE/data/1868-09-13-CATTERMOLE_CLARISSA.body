I cannot undertake to make any explanation to Forster, or to convey anything to him that you have not yourself written. The course to take in reference to seeking a pension<note>Cattermole, the co-illustrator of <hi rend="italic">The Old Curiosity Shop</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Barnaby Rudge</hi>, had died, 24 July, “Very, very poor. Family quite unprovided for; debt and distress” (<hi rend="italic">To</hi> Wills, 26 July 68, Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 12, pp. 158-9), and CD was assisting his family.</note> is to memorialize Mr. D’Israeli, the Prime Minister.<note> Disraeli had been Prime Minister since Feb. The Memorial was presented to Disraeli shortly before his resignation (Dec 68); it was presented again, to Gladstone, early in 1869 (<hi rend="italic">To</hi> W. P. Frith, [19] Jan 69; Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 12, p. 277): nothing came of it.</note> It is the only course I know of. The Memorial need set forth no more than is in the “Appeal”.<note>While doubting the usefulness of an appeal, even before Cattermole’s death (<hi rend="italic">To</hi> Mrs Cattermole, 2 July 68 in Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 12, pp. 144-5), CD drafted an Appeal (see Appx E) and opened an account at Coutts, which he controlled (<hi rend="italic">To</hi> W. P. Frith, 16 Nov 68, Pilgrim Letters 12, p. 221). CD sent Mrs Cattermole a cheque for just over £542 in Apr 69, the entire sum collected (Pilgrim Letters 12, pp. 332-3 &amp; <hi rend="italic">nn</hi>).</note> It should be signed by the best known Painters, and, so signed, I think would attract attention. I doubt Quin’s<note>Dr F. H. F. Quin (1799-1878; <hi rend="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</hi>), homoeopathic physician. Presumably Mrs Cattermole had suggested his medical testimony would reinforce her case</note> being of any use in the matter, and it came to my knowledge but yesterday that Lytton<note>Edward George Bulwer-Lytton, Bart, later 1st Baron Lytton (1803-73; <hi rend="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</hi>), writer and politician.</note> is not on such terms with the Government that he will ask any favors of them.
