     I received your letter at Malvern.<note>CD travelled to Malvern in March 1851 so that his wife Catherine might receive treatment from Dr James Wilson for a nervous illness — probably abnormally long-lasting attacks of migraine combined with post-natal depression.</note> Since then I have been in some trouble. The sudden death of a little daughter<note>CD's daughter Dora had died suddenly on 14 Apr 1851.</note> – she was called Dora, in remembrance of a book you have read<note>CD had named his daughter after the first wife of the protagonist in <hi rend="italic">David Copperfield</hi>. CD expressed similar sentiments in letters to Emile de la Rue on 25 Apr 1851, and Lydia Sigourney on 24 May 1851; see Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 6, pp. 363, 400.</note> – has much afflicted us. But I cannot refrain from thanking you, and assuring you that I am truly gratified by your communication.
