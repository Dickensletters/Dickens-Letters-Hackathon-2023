I have the honor to make the present application w[ith] you, for permission to plant a row of lime-trees on the side of the highroad along the whole wall-frontage of my property here. I trust you may be of opinion that the road could sustain no damage from being so ornamented, and that the appearance of the trees would be refreshing and pleasant to passers by. It is scarcely necessary to add that I will readily submit myself to any conditions with which your permissionâ€¦may be accompanied....Your faithful servant, CHARLES DICKENS
