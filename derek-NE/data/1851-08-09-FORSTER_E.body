I am exceedingly sorry to be so unfortunate; but on Tuesday last, I was occupied at a little distance from London all day, and on Wednesday was obliged to go to the ancient City of Rochester.<note>CD was in Broadstairs 28 May-20 Aug. He was in London, 4-8 Aug; his engagements on Tuesday (5 Aug) and Wednesday not otherwise known.</note> Since then, I have come here, and I fear that I am little likely to be in London again at any certain time, until next month.
