On coming to town this morning, I find your enclosure of a cheque for £20 in payment for the Drawing room cornices and the Turkey carpet at Tavistock House.<note>CD had asked Davis’s wife, Eliza, to indicate what fittings in Tavistock House she wished to buy before he moved (<hi rend="italic">To</hi> Davis, 23 Aug, Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 9, p. 294). Mrs Davis later protested to CD about the representation of Fagin as Jew in Oliver Twist (To Mrs Davis, 10 July 63, Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 10, pp. 269-70 &amp; nn).</note> I beg to acknowledge its safe receipt with thanks.
