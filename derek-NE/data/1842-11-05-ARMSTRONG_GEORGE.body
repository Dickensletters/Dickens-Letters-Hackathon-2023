In all the sentiments you express, relative to the splendid abilities and high usefulness of the great Man<note>The Rev.William Ellery Channing (1780-1842; Dictionary of National Biography), Unitarian minister of the Federal Street Church, Boston, since 1803; acclaimed in both America and Europe as a man of letters and social thinker. CD and Catherine had breakfast with him in Boston, 2 Feb 42 (Pilgrim Letters 3, p. 31). News of his death was noticed in London papers, 1 Nov. See further Pilgrim Letters 3, p. 16n.</note> whose death, in common with many thousands, we both sincerely deplore, I most heartily and thoroughly concur. And yet I cannot—believe me, cannot take upon myself the task of endeavouring, with my pen, to do justice to his honored memory.<note>Armstrong wrote to CD, urging him “to seize this opportunity...for fixing the attention of the reading world, on both sides of the Atlantic” on that “most gifted of Christian teachers” (in R. Henderson, <hi rend="italic">A Memoir of the Late Rev. George Armstrong</hi>, 1859; see Vol. III, p. 362 hn&amp; n.2).</note>
