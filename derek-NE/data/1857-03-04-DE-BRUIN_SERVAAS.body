I regret to inform you that the little paper on the Unicorn is not suited to Household Words. I do not think the existence of such an animal sufficiently probable, to render the subject worth mooting. I do not return the paper, because of the expense of postage. But I carefully reserve it, for you to reclaim in any way most convenient to yourself. Let me hope that I may yet have it in my power to send you a more agreeable communication.<note>Nothing by de Bruin was published in <hi rend="italic">Household Words</hi>.</note>
