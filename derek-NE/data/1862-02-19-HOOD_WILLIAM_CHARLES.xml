         <p>The gift is unfortunately bestowed elsewhere. I know the fact, or I would have immediately represented your case.<note>Presumably Hood was asking CD’s support in placing one of his patients in an institution.</note> You will see a reference to yourself (and not a disagreeable one, I hope) in our today’s No.<note>Hood is referred to twice in “M.D. and M.A.D.”, <hi rend="italic">All the Year Round</hi>, 22 Feb 62, VI, 511 and 513. The article, based on a hearing in the Commission of Lunacy to determine whether William Frederick Windham (“Mad Windham”) of Felbrigg Hall, Norfolk, should be declared incapable of managing his own affairs (reported extensively in <hi rend="italic">The Times</hi>, 17 Dec 61 onwards: the hearing occupied 34 days), attacks the system of expert witnesses being retained by either prosecution or defence and giving their opinions accordingly, regardless of facts. Dr Hood (“who should be an authority”) is honourably mentioned both for his part in the hearing and for his effort “to be helpful to a foolish and neglected youth” (<hi rend="italic">All the Year Round</hi>, VI, 511, 513). On Windham (who was clearly incapable of managing his own affairs), see further R.W. Ketton-Cremer, <hi rend="italic">Felbrigg: The Story of a House</hi>, 1962, ch.XIII. Hood had been earlier referred to in “The Star of Bethlehem”, <hi rend="italic">Household Words</hi>, 15 Aug 57, XVI, 145.</note> </p>
