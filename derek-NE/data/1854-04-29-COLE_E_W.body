I regret that I cannot preside at the annual Meeting of the Institution.<note>CD had spoken at the Annual Meetings of 1849 and 1852. On 13 Apr to Cole (Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 7, p. 311) he indicated his willingness to become President of the Institution and was elected 22 May at the annual meeting. He presided at the next annual meeting, 21 May 55.</note> But my occupations, and the recreations that are necessary to them, have obliged me, this year, to abstain from accepting any such public Engagement. I have refused many, conditionally; replying to the urgent invitations, “If I go anywhere, I will come to you.” My appearance in this case, would involve me in innumerable others; and I am obliged – positively obliged – to decline. My attendances at public meetings at any time, are very few and far between.
