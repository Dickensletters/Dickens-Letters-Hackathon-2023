I regret to say that I cannot leave home this evening. Catherine is not so well as she was;<note>Charley had been born on 6 Jan.</note> and we have a consultation here, at six o’clock. I was seized last night with a violent pain in my head (fortunately, just as I had concluded my month’s work) and was immediately ordered as much medicine as would confine an ordinary-sized horse to his stall for a week. Whether it arises from the “Influentials”,<note>I.e. influenza</note> or from close application, or from worry, or from the wind cholic, to quote King Arthur,<note>In Fielding’s <hi rend="italic">The Great Tragedy of Tragedies</hi>; or, <hi rend="italic">The Life and Death of Tom Thumb the Great</hi>, I, <hi rend="italic">iii</hi>.</note> I know not. But this I know – that sorely against my will and much to my disappointment, here I am, in a gloomy and miserable state, and here I must remain.
