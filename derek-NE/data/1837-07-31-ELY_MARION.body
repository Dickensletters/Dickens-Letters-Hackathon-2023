Let me beg you if you can, to excuse my apparent neglect in not sending Paracelsus<note>Robert Browning’s second book, a dramatic poem, 1835, based on the historical Paracelsus (1493-1541), Swiss-born physician and mystic. The poem’s critical success launched Browning’s career. CD may have been prompted to borrow and read <hi rend="italic">Paracelsus</hi> by his first meeting with Browning, 26 June, in Macready’s dressing-room. The poem was reprinted in Poems, 2 vols, 1849, which 135 was in CD’s library at its 1878 sale Catalogue of the Library of CD, ed. J. H. Stonehouse).(</note> before.
