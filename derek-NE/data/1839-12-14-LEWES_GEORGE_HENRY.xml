         <p>I think it very unlikely that the Shakespeare Club<note>The Shakespeare Club met at the Piazza Coffee House, Covent Garden; CD and Forster were members and Frank Stone was Hon. Secretary: see Marcus Stone’s account of the Club in D, XLI (1944-5), 40-1. The Club’s aim was “to combine intellectual with social enjoyment”: see Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 1, p. 392n.</note> will be disposed to receive any new Members, as they have some reason to repent themselves of their past errors in that respect, and will probably for a time run into the opposite extreme. Even if they are disposed to elect, I have determined for various cogent reasons not to propose. But, should they trawl beyond certain selections from their old brethren, I shall take care to make your wish known to the Club generally, or to whatever committee or sub committee may regulate its proceedings – which are at present unfathomable.<note>Founded in 1838, the Club had last met on 7 December 1839, when it was broken up by Forster’s high-handed behaviour: see Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 1, p. 611n; hence CD’s uncertainty of its future activities.</note></p>
