  The last English Judge, I believe, who gave expression to a public and judicial opinion in favour of the Punishment of Death, is Mr. Justice Coleridge,<note>Sir John Taylor Coleridge (1790-1876; <hi rend="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</hi>); judge and nephew of the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge. The full statement was reported in the <hi rend="italic">Hertford Mercury</hi> (12 July 1845).</note> who, in charging the Grand Jury at Hertford last year, took occasion to lament the presence of serious crimes in the calendar, and to say that he feared they were referable to the comparative infrequency of Capital Punishment.
