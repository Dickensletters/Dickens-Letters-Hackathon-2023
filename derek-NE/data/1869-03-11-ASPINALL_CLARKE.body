...I owe you many thanks for your two kind letters. Excuse my troubling you by adding one name which by an oversight I omitted yesterday—that of Mr. Arthur Chappell.<note> Arthur Chappell (1834-1904) of Chappell &amp; Co., music publishers, promoters of CD’s reading tours since 1866. For the others for whom CD has sought Aspinall’s assistance to obtain tickets, see <hi rend="italic">To</hi> Aspinall, 9 Mar 69 (Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 12, pp. 308-309).
