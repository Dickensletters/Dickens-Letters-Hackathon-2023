I send you enclosed, an order on Bradbury and Evans for 12 Little Dorrits.<note>The final double No. of <hi rend="italic">Little Dorrit</hi>, for June, was published 30 May 57. CD had already asked for presentation copies to be bound (Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 8, pp. 327, 335).</note> Will you, with all convenient dispatch, half-bind 9 in my favorite red with gilt leaves, and bind the remaining 3 in any elegant and substantial way you like. When done, please send them to the Household Words office with “Books to await Mr. Dickens” written outside.
