I am very much obliged to you for your pamphlet,<note>Batsonâ€™s <hi rend="italic">How to Improve the Condition of the Agricultural Labourer. A self supporting system, by which boys may be trained in acts of industry, and at the same time receive a suitable education</hi> 1851.</note> which I have read with great interest. I hope it would not be in the tendency of such a system, to place the Men (in the neighbourhood where it might be extensively adopted) at a disadvantage? But for a suspicion that this objection might attach to it if it were established on a greater scale, I regard it as a sound and hopeful work.
