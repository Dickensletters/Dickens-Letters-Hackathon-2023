 I regret exceedingly that I cannot have the pleasure of dining with yourself and Mr Pender on Sunday. But I have a family party at Gad's Hill, and I shall have Mr Fechter<note>Charles Albert Fechter (1824-79); actor and playwright. CD first saw him perform in 1856, and thought him one of the finest actors of his generation (see Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 9, p. 405). The pair were close friends in the 1860s. On Fechter's accompanying CD to Gad's Hill for the party see <hi rend="italic">To</hi> Georgina Hogarth, 20 June 1863, in Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 10, p. 262.</note> there too. I am singularly unfortunate when you invite me.
