 I regret that I am prevented by business which I must attend to, from coming to you to day. I will be with you tomorrow at 12.<note>CD was arranging sittings for the bust commissioned by Basil Hall, a great admirer of CD's work; see Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 2, p. 245. Samuel Haydon, a friend of John Dickens and the family, saw the bust at the time CD was sitting for it ("always accompanied by some friend") and considered it admirable, "full of life" (F. G. Kitton, CD by <hi rend="italic">Pen and Pencil</hi>, I, 20). But Hall, presumably because of his breakdown in 1842, failed to buy it; and in July 1848 Joseph, then bankrupt, was still seeking a purchaser. CD admired the bust, but declined buying it himself. The clay model, never even cast into plaster, was later destroyed (F. G. Kitton, ibid).</note>
