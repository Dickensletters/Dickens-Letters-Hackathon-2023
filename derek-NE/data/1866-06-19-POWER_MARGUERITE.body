I am extremely pleased with the Vine,<note>Thus in MS. Power was the author of the poem 'The Vines', <hi rend="italic">All the Year Round</hi> 15 (7 July 1866): 609-10.</note> as a charming and elegant little poem – in which I assuredly see no trace of the difficulty you speak of.<note>Possibly Power’s failing health; she suffered a spinal injury after a fall from a horse, and died after a long battle with cancer. See To Mrs Henderson, 4 July 1867, Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 11, p. 390.</note> To the best of my belief it comes in innumerable cases – and (happily) goes.
