         <p>A thousand thanks for your kind and considerate note.<note>Presumably with news from India, where the 'Mutiny' had effectively ended in Mar 58, though fighting continued in Oudh into June.</note> I received at the same time, one from my boy in India,<note>Walter Dickens (1841-63), attached from the outbreak of the Indian 'Mutiny' to the 42nd Highlanders; saw action at Cawnpore (Dec 57) and Lucknow (Mar 58): see <hi rend="italic">To</hi> Boyle, 5 Feb, Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 8, p. 516 &amp; n.</note> wherein he said he had seen your Patriarch,<note>Presumably a joking name for the Procters’ son, Montagu (1830-85); served in the 'Mutiny'.</note> and was going to “Tiffin”<note>A light meal; luncheon (<hi rend="italic">Oxford English Dictionary</hi>).</note> with him next day. I wonder whether the “Moonshee”<note>A native secretary or language-teacher in India: also “munshi” (<hi rend="italic">Oxford English Dictionary</hi>).</note> was of the party. I wonder whether I should like to know a Moonshee. As at present advised, I think not. I am heartily glad to hear that our dear Miss Bewick<note>Thus in MS; Mary Berwick was the pseudonym of Adelaide Anne Procter (1825-64), daughter of Ann and Bryan Procter; contributed poems to <hi rend="italic">Household Words</hi> from Feb 53. CD published her work for almost two years before discovering her identity (see <hi rend="italic">To</hi> Adelaide Procter, 17 Dec 54, Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 7, p. 486 &amp; nn).</note> has achieved so great a success.<note>Her collected poems, <hi rend="italic">Legends and Lyrics</hi>: A Book of Verses, 1858; republished posthumously, 1866, with an introduction by CD.</note> Pray congratulate her, most cordially, from me. And with Love to Procter, and with Love to yourself, Believe me ever</p>
