My Dear Talfourd, Mrs Warner<note>Mary Amelia Warner, née Huddart (1804-54; <hi rend="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</hi>), actress. Married Robert William Warner, c. 1837. Had great success on the London stage, 1830-51. When she developed cancer in the early 1850s and was in financial difficulties, CD among others assisted her: see further Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 7, pp.116n, 271, 302 &amp; nn.</note> is taken suddenly ill, and cannot play in your tragedy.<note>Talfourd’s tragedy, <hi rend="italic">The Athenian Captive</hi>, which Macready was rehearsing; the cause for a time of strained relations between Macready and Talfourd. Performed eventually on 4 Aug at the Haymarket Theatre, under Benjamin Webster’s management, with Mrs Warner as Ismene, Queen of Corinth, and Macready as the captive, her son, Thoas.</note> The only possible way to prevent postponement, is, for you to see Miss Faucit<note>Helen (later Helena) Saville Faucit (1817-98; <hi rend="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</hi>), actress;Macready’s leading lady at Covent Garden, 1836-8. Married (Sir) Theodore Martin, 1851; author of <hi rend="italic">On Some of Shakespeare’s Female Characters</hi>, 1855, drawing effectively upon her stage experience: see further Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 3, p.597n.</note> tonight<note>Coriolanus was being performed. Mrs Warner was billed to play Volumnia; Macready, on learning of her indisposition, called on Mrs Clifford, due to play Valeria, to take the part (<hi rend="italic">Diaries</hi>, I, 453). Helen Faucit, not billed to appear that night, presumably took over Valeria. The part is very small, but could be made effective, particularly in Act V, accompanying Volumnia to plead with Coriolanus, by a silent presence: such an ability is required of the actress playing Ismene. <hi rend="italic">The Times</hi> (6 Aug) noted how in The Athenian Captive, since Ismene is “scarcely ever off the stage” in the first two acts and yet “has scarcely a word to say”, the acting is “left to the performer”.</note>…and ask her to play the part. Forster and I have thought it our duty to you, to come from the theatre immediately on hearing the news, and acquaint you with it. We will wait in a cab at theb acorner of Lord Lansdowne’s Garden Wall for 10 Minutes if you think it necessary to come to us.
