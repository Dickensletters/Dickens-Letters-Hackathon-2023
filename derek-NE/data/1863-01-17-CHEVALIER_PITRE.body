By a mistake of my servant’s,<note>John Thompson, CD’s servant since the 1830s and with CD in Paris.</note> I find (only this morning) that a letter I wrote to you on Thursday to acknowledge your obliging and amiable invitation, was never delivered. I entreat you to accept my excuses. If I had been here on Tuesday last, it would have afforded me great pleasure to have [ ]<note>Several illegible words scored out by CD.</note> assisted at your interesting reunion. But I did not arrive in Paris until Wednesday night. Accept, my Dear Sir, the assurance of my highest consideration and most cordial regard.
