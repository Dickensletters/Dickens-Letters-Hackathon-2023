I am very sorry that, owing to my absence from London, I did not receive your letter until Saturday last. And I regret that my engagements will not admit of my accepting the invitation with which I am honored by the Plymouth Mechanicsâ€™ Institute.<note>Founded 1825; CD presumably had been asked to give an address at the inauguration of the Institute's new building in Princess Square, 10 Sep.</note> I esteem and appreciate that invitation, and have the warmest sympathy with all such excellent associations, but my avocations render it out of my power to attend.
