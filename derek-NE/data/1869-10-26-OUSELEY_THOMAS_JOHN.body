I am very sensible of the Earnest terms in which you propose to dedicate your Volume to me,<note>Poems (London &amp; Isle ofMan), 1870. A lengthy dedication to CD, “whose prose is the poetry of the Heart”, compares him to Jesus and Shakespeare, and hails him as the “Novelist of the Hearth”. An inscribed copy is in the 1878 sale <hi rend="italic">Catalogue of the Library of CD</hi> (ed. Stonehouse).</note> and I hasten to assure you that I shall highly esteem that honor. The Volume of poems to which you refer, still holds its place on my book shelves.<note><hi rend="italic">A Vision of Death’s Destruction and Other Poems</hi>, 1839 (3rd edn). The 1844 Devonshire Terrace Inventory lists two copies of poems by Ouseley (Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 4, p. 713); one presumably <hi rend="italic">A Vision</hi>, the second possibly <hi rend="italic">The Porte-Feuille and Miscellaneous Poems</hi>, 1836. Neither volume appears in the <hi rend="italic">Catalogue of the Library of CD</hi>.</note>
