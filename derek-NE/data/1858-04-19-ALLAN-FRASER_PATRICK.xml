         <p> I have not a doubt that such a provision as you describe in your letter from Hawkesbury Hall would carry out, in an admirable manner, the principles and objects of the Guild.<note>Fraser and his wife Elizabeth offered to donate Hawkesbury Hall in Warwickshire, which Elizabeth had inherited from her mother, to the Guild of Literature and Art, founded with CD’s assistance in 1851. See Michael Slater, "Munificence Declined: New Letters about the Guild of Literature and Art", <hi rend="italic">Dickensian</hi> 111.1 (2015): 34-41. See also CD’s letters to Fraser of 3 May 1858, 12 May 1858, and 22 May 1858.</note></p>
<p>You will readily believe that I have not been unmindful of your munificent and generous intentions because I have delayed writing to you.  Immediately after I had the pleasure of seeing you, I conferred with Mr. Ouvry3 the Guild solicitor, on the subject of our conversation. He was of opinion that it would be necessary to apply to Parliament for an act to enlarge and amend our present Bill.4 Not being quite clear on the subject, however, he proposed to lay a case before our Honorary Standing Counsel, Mr. Wordsworth.5 This he did at once, but (owing, I think, to absence on Circuit business), the opinion has not yet been given.</p>
<p>In the meantime I have deferred writing to you, expecting every day to have something more distinct to tell you. Not feeling satisfied, however, to leave your kind note longer unanswered, I write after all, still waiting for the opinion.</p>
<p>Mr. Ouvry deemed it better not to communicate with Mr Roberts6 until he should receive his case back from Mr Wordsworth. Both he and I will pursue the subject (he with Mr. Roberts, and I with you) without a moment’s loss of time you may be sure.</p>
