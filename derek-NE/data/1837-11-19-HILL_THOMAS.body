Very many thanks for the papers,<note> Unidentified </note> which I will safely return, â€“ and also for the opportunity of perusing Mr Hook's<note>Theodore Edward Hook (1788-1841; <hi rend="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</hi>), writer, wit and vigorous lampooner; contributed to <hi rend="italic">Bentley's Miscellany</hi>. Though CD did not get to know him well, as he had hoped, he commented sensitively on his death in a letter to Washington Irving (Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 2, p. 396).</note> note. I assure you that I am most anxious to improve an acquaintance with him, and shall be delighted if we ever grow intimate, as I hope we may when the wind takes lodgings in some other quarter.<note>CD's joke relates to the proverb "When the wind is in the east, 'tis neither good for man nor beast".</note>
