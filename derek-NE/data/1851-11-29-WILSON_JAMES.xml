         <p>I send you the books we spoke of.<note>Presumably CD and Wilson had met early Nov, during Wilson’s monthly visit to London. The books unidentified, though David Copperfield likely to be one.</note> Pray accept them with my most cordial thanks for all your kindness and generosity, and for the great consideration and care with which you treated Mrs. Dickens when she was ill.<note>CD took Catherine to Malvern for the Water Cure under the care of Wilson (Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 6, p. 314) from 15 Mar until 15 Apr, when CD sent a letter by Forster to bring her back to London after the death of Dora (Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 6, p. 353). On 17 Apr Forster wrote toWilson, after describing Catherine’s condition: “Mr. Dickens will be well pleased to hear from you. I know the reliance he places on your judgement” (MS Private).</note> She and her sister join me in friendly regards to yourself and Mrs. Wilson.</p>
<p>Dr. Wilson.</p>
