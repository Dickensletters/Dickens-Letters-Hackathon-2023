         </opener>
         <p>I do not remember to have received any such communication from you as you describe in your letter dated four days since. As I have left Tavistock House these two years,<note>On Tavistock Square in Bloomsbury, where CD lived from 1851 to 1860.</note> it may have gone to my office in London<note>The office of CD's journal, <hi rend="italic">All the Year Round</hi>, at 26 Wellington Street, Strand.</note> and have been set aside by some mistake in the great accumulation of correspondence there.</p>
<p>It is with regret that I convey you the assurance of my inability to comply with the request of the Wedgwood Memorial Committee.<note>A proposal for an institute honouring the memory of master potter Josiah Wedgwood (1730-95) was made by the Earl of Carlisle at a town meeting in Burslem on the 27 January 1859; this called for funds for erecting a "memorial building", comprising a library, school of art, and museum. The foundation stone was laid on 26 October 1863; see <hi rend="italic">Wedgwood: An Address. By the Right Hon. W.E. Gladstone</hi> (London: John Murray, 1863).</note> But I have lately done all that I can reasonably afford to do in such wise.<note>The request from Woodall was for a speech, rather than a financial donation. CD delivered an address on behalf of the Royal General Theatrical Fund on 4 Apr, and had agreed to give another speech, at the annual dinner of the Royal Free Hospital, on 6 May.</note></p>
