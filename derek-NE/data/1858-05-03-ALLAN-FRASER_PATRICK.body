I have heard from Mr Ouvry<note>Frederic Ouvry (1814-81), CD's solicitor from 1856.</note> the Guild Solicitor, who is now (I believe) in communication with your Solicitor. It seems that our Act of Parliament<note>The Private Act to incorporate the Guild of Literature and Art was passed on 2 June 1854.</note> does not give us the power of holding your most generous gift,<note>CD proposed that Ouvry seek an amendment of the Act of Parliament incorporating the Guild of Literature and Art, to enable the Guild to accept a gift of land from Allan-Fraser. See To Ouvry, [?10 May 1858], Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 8, p. 562. See also Michael Slater, "Munificence Declined: New Letters about the Guild of Literature and Art", Dickensian 111.1 (2015): 34-41.</note> and that if no better way of putting us in possession of it can be struck out, we must apply to Parliament to alter our Act to meet the specific case. I dare say you will shortly hear from your legal adviser if you have not already done so.
