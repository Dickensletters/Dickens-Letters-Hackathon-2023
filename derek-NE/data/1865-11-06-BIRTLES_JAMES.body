I will send you round the <note>No doubt for<hi rend="italic"> All the Year Round</hi>, but not identified.</note> concluding folios of the enclosed paper2 at about noon to day. Tomorrow morning I will begin to make up the Xmas No.<note><hi rend="italic">Doctor Marigold’s Prescriptions</hi>, <hi rend="italic">All the Year Round</hi>  Xmas No., published 7 Dec 65. Birtles had by now received the first three stories (<hi rend="italic">To</hi> Birtles, 7 Nov, Pilgrim Letters 11). CD “made up” the No. with another five stories, including his own “To Be Taken with a Grain of Salt” and “To be Taken for Life”; he then spent 8 Nov with Births, “making up” the No. for printing, “always a tough job” (<hi rend="italic">To</hi> Lehmann, 7 Nov, Pilgrim Letters 11). Speed was essential: galley proofs had to be read and corrected, the rest of the MS typeset and finally the type broken up into double-column pages. The No. was in print by 17 Nov, when CD sent Charles Kent a confidential copy.</note> and will enable you to go on breaking it into pages.
