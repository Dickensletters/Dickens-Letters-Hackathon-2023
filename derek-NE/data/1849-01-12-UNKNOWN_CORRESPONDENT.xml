            <salute>Dear Mr. [ ]<note>The name, of some 8 or 10 characters, has been cut away; clearly the Unknown Correspondent of 5 Jan (Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 5, p. 469); that letter is similarly mutilated.</note></salute>

         <p>I am much obliged to you for your kind information about the Cenci.<note>A Roman family, notorious for the supposed incestuous rape by Count Cenci of his daughter Beatrice, his murder at her instigation, and the execution of Beatrice, her step-mother, and brother in 1599. A portrait supposedly of Beatrice by Guido Reni (formerly in the Palazzo Colonna; now in the Palazzo Barberini) was much admired in the nineteenth century: CD describes it in <hi rend="italic">Pictures from Italy</hi> (“Rome”) and it is an obsessive object in Nathaniel Hawthorne’s <hi rend="italic">The Marble Faun</hi>, 1860</note> I will not trouble you to get the account transcribed (though you have so stimulated my curiosity that I must go and read it myself)<note>This “account” not identified; presumably in a printed source, possibly a magazine. James Whittle, “Beatrice Cenci, the Parricide”, <hi rend="italic">Bentley’s Miscellany</hi>, XXII (1847), 105-18, is possible. George Bowyer, <hi rend="italic">A Dissertation on the Statutes of the Cities of Italy</hi>, 1838, appended a translation of the “Pleading of Prospero Farinacio in defence of Beatrice Cenci and Her Relatives”.</note> for I merely wanted the narrative to send to a lady-borrower,<note>To whom CD had promised to lend an account: see <hi rend="italic">To</hi> Unknown Correspondent, 5 Jan.</note> and the account prefixed to Shelley’s poem<note>Shelley’s poetic drama, <hi rend="italic">CThe Cenci</hi> (1819); Shelley claimed to have come to the subject through a manuscript shown him in 1818.</note> will answer her purpose well enough.</p>
