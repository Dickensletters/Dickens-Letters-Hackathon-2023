Wills was debilitated by an eye problem; see Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 7, pp. 27, 36.</note> or I should have written you a private note to shew you only I believe you to be quite as wrong now, about the spontaneous combustion question,<note>Lewes objected to CD's depiction of the death of Krook by spontaneous combustion in chapter 32 of Bleak House (published 1 Dec 1852). He had accused CD, in the Leader's "Literature" column, 11 Dec 1852, of picking up the idea of spontaneous combustion "among the curiosities of his reading"; he added, "Captain Marryat, it may be remembered, employed the same equivocal incident in Jacob Faithful." After CD had inserted a list of his authorities in <hi rend="italic">Bleak House</hi>, chapter 33 (published 1 Jan 1853), Lewes attacked him again in the Leader, on 15 Jan 1853. Lewes also published "Two Letters to Charles Dickens" in the <hi rend="italic">Leader,</hi> on 5 and 12 Feb 1853. In the first piece he included a list of "authorities of ... commanding eminence" who refuted the possibility of spontaneous combustion.</note> as you were in the beginning. I hope to do so, early in the next week.<note>CD wrote to Lewes as promised, on 25 February, providing evidence to counter Lewes's argument; see Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 7, pp. 28-31.</note>
