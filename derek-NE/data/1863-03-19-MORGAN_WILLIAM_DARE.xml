         <p>I should not find it easy to tell you if I tried – and I am not going to try – how very much obliged to you I feel for your prompt assistance and sound good sense in the matter of Frank.<note>Francis Jeffrey Dickens (1844-86), CD's son.</note> I do not write for any such impracticable purpose, but merely to advise you that Charley will give you my cheque for £20, for remittance to your good father.<note>Captain Elisha Ely Morgan(?1805-64), CD's friend. CD paid W.D. Morgan £20 on 23 March 1863 (CD’s account, Coutts’s Bank).</note> If he will kindly undertake (as you suggest he will) to provide the boy with money according to his – your father’s – discretion, I shall have a far higher reliance on its being a sound one in such a case, than I should have upon the soundness of my own. Nor should I think of questioning the expedience and advantage of any drafts that your father<note>‘He’ cancelled; ‘your father’ added over caret.
</note> might draw upon me, if he were satisfied that they were to Frank’s real advantage.</p>
