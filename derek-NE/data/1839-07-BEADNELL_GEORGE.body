I find that the ticket of our box does not mention on which side of the house<note>Covent Garden Theatre, which fronts on Bow Street.</note> it is. There is a private box entrance next the grand entrance in Bow Street, and another out of the Court Yard in Hart Street. You will hear of us at one, but I should recommend you to try the Bow Street door first, as we are usually on that side. The Box will stand on the boxkeeper’s list<note>The boxkeeper kept a list of those who had rented a box for the season and of those boxes to which access was allowed by loan or by favour of the management: e.g. CD used Macready’s box, 13 Oct 38 (Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 1, p. 440<hi rend="italic">n</hi>).</note> in the name of MR.FORSTER.<note>Doubly underlined.</note>
