I hope you may not have thought me unmindful of your pleasant letter, or unwilling to comply with its request. Several circumstances have combined of late, to render me even less available than usual for letter-writing.<note>For similar excuses since the beginning of the year, see e.g. <hi rend="italic">To</hi> Collins, 25 Jan 64 (Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 10, p. 346). Besides normal business and social engagements, CD had had to cope with the recent deaths of his mother (September 1863); of Thackeray (December 1863), writing “In Memoriam” for the <hi rend="italic">Cornhill</hi>, Feb 64, IX, 129-32; and of Walter Landor Dickens, news of which reached him in early February 1864. He was working on <hi rend="italic">Our Mutual Friend</hi>, getting No.1 set up in print by mid February for Marcus Stone to provide titlepage and illustrations (Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 10, p. 357), while searching for a London house to rent from February to June. He had also been away for a few days in both early January and early February.</note> With this, I have the pleasure of sending you a copy of David Copperfield.<note>The source says the two-volume 1859 edition, inscribed “The Rev. T. W. Goldhawk From Charles Dickens, Third March 1864”.</note> My two daughters (the younger married)<note>Kate had married Charles Collins in 1860.</note> beg me to convey to you their kind regard. A poor boy whom you christened,<note>Walter Landor, baptised 8 Feb 1841 at St Marylebone church. CD is mistaken about when he first knew Goldhawk, who does not appear in the Clergy List until 1845. The baptismal record (National Metropolitan Archives) names G.H.Thompson (curate, Holy Trinity, Tottenham, 1830-45) as performing the ceremony. CD presumably knew Goldhawk while living at Devonshire Terrace.</note> died in India,<note>See <hi rend="italic">To</hi> Barrow, 23 Feb, above.
