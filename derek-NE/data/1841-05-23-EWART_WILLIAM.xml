         <p>I am much obliged to you for your note, and for your kind attention. I am not likely to see Mrs Wilby<note>Maria A. Wilby, author of <hi rend="italic">A Cry from the Opprest and Other Poems</hi>, 1838, dedicated, with complaints of calumny, to the Lord Chancellor: see Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 12 (Addenda), p. 576<hi rend="italic">n</hi>.</note> whom I have never seen in my life; but when I sent the Petition to her for her signature, I was extremely careful to caution her against expecting that anything would come of its presentation<note>Her husband’s death in 1818 left Mrs Wilby and her children financially distressed. The petition was possibly to the Royal Literary Fund or, since CD met Ewart, 3 May 41 (Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 2, p. 278), to discuss her situation, a request to Parliament for a pension.</note> – I repeatedly stated the same thing to her daughter when she asked me to draw it – and I fully believe that they perfectly understand the real state of the case. </p>
