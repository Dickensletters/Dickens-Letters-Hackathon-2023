<p>I have handed your note to them; and have informed them, for the second time, that I am anxious to oblige Mr. Tauchnitz<note>Baron Bernhard Christian Tauchnitz (1816-95), publisher, of Leipzig. Born at Schleinitz; nephew of the publisher Karl Tauchnitz. Founded his own firm in Leipzig in 1837. The firm began its “Collection of British Authors” Sep 1841 with Bulwer Lytton’s Pelham. <hi rend="italic">Pickwick Papers</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Oliver Twist</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">American Notes</hi> had appeared before the end of 1842, and <hi rend="italic">Nicholas Nickleby</hi> in June 1843. He and CD became friendly, and CD sent Charley to Leipzig to learn German. According to John Forster, Tauchnitz always paid liberally. He wrote to Forster after CD’s death: “All Mr Dickens’s works have been published under agreement by me. My intercourse with him lasted nearly twenty-seven years. The first of his letters dates in October 1843, and his last at the close of March, 1870 [see <hi rend="italic">To</hi> Tauchnitz, 31 March 1870]. Our long relations were not only never troubled by the least disagreement, but were the occasion of most hearty personal feeling; and I shall never lose the sense of his kind and friendly nature. On my asking him his terms for Edwin Drood, he replied, ‘Your terms shall be mine’” (John Forster, <hi rend="italic">The Life of Charles Dickens</hi>, ed. J.W.T. Ley, p. 807n).</note> in all possible respects, as he behaved in a very honorable manner on the last occasion of my having any communication with him, observing my invariable principle in such matters. I do not wish to interfere beyond this.
