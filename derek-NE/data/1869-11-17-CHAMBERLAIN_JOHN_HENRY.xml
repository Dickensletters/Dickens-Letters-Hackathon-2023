         <p>I send you the Speech corrected.<note>CD’s speech as Chairman of the Institute, at the Annual Inaugural Meeting on 27 Sep; he had agreed to its publication by the Council and offered to correct the proofs: see <hi rend="italic">Speeches of Charles Dickens</hi>, ed. K. J. Fielding, 1960, p. 435.</note></p>
<p>The enigmatical concluding sentence would (I think) never have had any mystery about it, if its proper capital letters, according to my emphasis, had been printed thus:-</p>
<p>My faith in the people

governing is on the whole infinitesimal;

my faith in The People governed is,

on the whole, illimitable.<note>The speech, which embodied CD’s ‘political creed’ had been published in the press without the capital letters and had been widely criticised for what was seen as his <hi rend="italic">‘antiliberalism’</hi>: see <hi rend="italic">Speeches of Charles Dickens</hi>, ed. K. J. Fielding, 1960, p. 419.</note></p>
