         <p>I have such a nervous dread of seeming to presume on my position by obtruding myself on the public in connexion with matters with which I have no immediate concern; and I so honestly feel the presumption of trumpeting my opinion of such a man as Dr. Channing, who is immortal in the hearts of all good men, that I shrink involuntarily from the idea of having my letter to you published;<note>Armstrong, replying to CD’s refusal to write anything about Channing (To Armstrong, 5 Nov 1842), regretfully admitted to its force, but had asked whether he might prefix to a discourse on Channing the expression of interest CD had conveyed in his letter (see Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 3, p. 362, n.2).</note> and I [ ]<note>CD here crossed out four words: they possibly read “cannot resist the impulse”.</note> must beg you, therefore, still to regard it in the light of a strictly private communication.</p>
