My absence from London<note>CD was in Gravesend, 7-15 Apr, to keep “an eye on the little repairs” at Gad’s Hill (<hi rend="italic">To</hi> Miss Coutts, 9 Apr; Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi~> 8, p. 310). He was clearing off accumulated correspondence on his return to London.</note> has prevented my returning an earlier reply to your letter, and sending back your Manuscript with thanks. I can hardly be expected to recognize the necessity of the question propounded at your Debating Society, as I may be reasonably supposed to have settled it very conclusively in my own mind. But it is extremely agreeable and gratifying to me to have so earnest a champion as yourself and to find the generous order of youth expressing itself so well, and with so strong a love of what is good and true.
