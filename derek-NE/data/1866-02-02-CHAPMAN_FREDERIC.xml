         <p>I am very sorry to hear that your wife<note>Clara Chapman, née Woodin, whom Chapman married on 21 November 1861</note> is so ill, and also that you have but newly passed through other domestic misfortunes. I hope that your removal of your invalid<note>Chapman had taken her to Bournemouth, where she died on 28 February 1866.</note> may lead to better results, and of course could not expect to see you at such a time. </p>
