            As I had a kind note from you before leaving America<note>CD left the United States on 7 June 1842, aboard the <hi rend="italic">George Washington</hi>.</note> (which is still unanswered) let me report that we are all well and happy, as I shall hope to hear you are – that everybody is cursing the Income Tax,<note>Income Tax had been introduced in 1842, imposed at the rate of 7d. in the pound on annual incomes above £150 (Stephen Dowell, <hi rend="italic">A History of Taxation and Taxes in England</hi>, vol. 2 [London: Longmans Green &amp;amp; Co., 1888], pp. 225, 263 &amp; 325). The 1842 legislation was officially the "Act for granting to Her Majesty Duties on Profits arising from Property, Professions, Trades and Offices"; the tax was usually referred to as "income and property tax": it was not called "income tax" until 1892, when the 1842 legislation was retrospectively renamed as the "Income Tax Act". On CD's payment of income tax see also To George Dolby, 3 Aug 1868.</note> except the men to whom it gives places<note>I.e. the people who benefit from it. The 1842 Budget and its introduction of Income Tax received little criticism from the Liberals (led by Lord John Russell) when first presented on 12 Mar 1842; however, in light of the strength of public feeling in the days that followed, they adopted a more critical position less than a week later. The public outcry centred on the tax's being applied to all income regardless of source (i.e. whether from property, or industrial or professional income), and at the same rate for anyone earning above £150 per year.</note> – and that there is nothing else new, in this Hemisphere.
