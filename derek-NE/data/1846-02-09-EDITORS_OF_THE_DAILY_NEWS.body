 I will take for the subject of this letter, the effect of Capital Punishment on the commission of crime, or rather of murder; the only crime with one exception (and that a rare one) to which it is now applied.<note>As Philip Collins notes, by 1832 “murder was virtually the only crime for which capital punishment was exacted” (<hi rend="italic">Dickens and Crime</hi>, 3rd ed., [London: Macmillan, 1994], p. 4). However, “high treason, arson in Royal Navy dockyards and arson of dwelling houses with persons therein, piracy with violence, robbery attended with wounds, and sodomy” were legally still capital crimes (Paroissien, p. 229).</note> Its effect in preventing crime, I will reserve for another letter:<note>To The Editors of the <hi rend="italic">Daily News<?hi>, 13 Mar 1846.</note> and a few of the more striking illustrations of each aspect of the subject, for a concluding one.<note>To The Editors of the <hi rend="italic">Daily News</hi>, 16 Mar 1846.</note>
