(a) criticising in whispers the cut of Kate’s dress,<note>The illustration, “Madame Mantalini introduces Kate to Miss Knag”, appeared in ch. XVII (“Follows the Fortunes of Miss Nickleby”), opposite p. 157 in the original vol. edn. Two girls on the right are shown whispering and a skylight can be seen; there is no cap on a block or dress on a stand. Miss Knag is about the height of Miss La Creevy (shown in ch. X, opposite p. 89), but her dress less extravagant and her appearance less amiable.</note> her face, and so forth. The room is lighted by a sky-light (if you shew any window at all); of course it is not the show-room described in No. 3, though there may be a cap on a block and a dress on a stand if it would improve the sketch. N.B. Please to take care that Miss Knag is not like Miss La Creevy. 2<note>Doubly underlined by CD.</note>
