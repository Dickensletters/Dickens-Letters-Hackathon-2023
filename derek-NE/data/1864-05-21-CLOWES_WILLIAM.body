Will you have the kindness to assure Mr. Bentley<note>Richard Bentley (1794-1871; <hi rend="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</hi>), publisher: see Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 1, p. 164n.

Quite apart from any unwillingness to become directly involved in Bentley’s business dealings, CD was running in <hi rend="italic">All the Year Round</hi> G. A. Sala’s <hi rend="italic">Quite Alone</hi> (concluded 12 Nov 64), overlapping it with Percy Fitzgerald’s <hi rend="italic">Never Forgotten</hi> (from 3 Sep 64), itself succeeded by Amelia B. Edwards’s <hi rend="italic">Half a Million of Money</hi> (from 22 Apr 65).</note>
