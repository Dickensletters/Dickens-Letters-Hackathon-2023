  I hasten to acknowledge the receipt of your book,<note>Bennett's Poems, reprinting two of his contributions to <hi rend="italic">Household Words</hi>, had been published by Chapman &amp;amp; Hall 1 Nov 1850.</note> and the very gratifying terms in which you have the kindness to present it to me. I assure you that I feel them strongly, and that you can have no more interested or approving reader than I have been for a long time.
