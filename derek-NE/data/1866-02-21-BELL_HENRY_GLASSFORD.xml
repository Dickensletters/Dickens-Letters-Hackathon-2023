         <p>I beg you to accept my cordial thanks for your acharming volume.<note><hi rend="italic">Romances and Minor Poems</hi>, 1866, which was in CD’s library at his death (<hi rend="italic">Catalogue of the Library of CD</hi>, ed. J. H. Stonehouse).</note> I have read it with great pleasure and admiration, and with renewed remembrance of a certain elegant sandal-wood box<note><hi rend="italic">The History of a Sandal Wood Box: written by itself</hi>., priv. printed [1848]. Written by Mrs Bell for her daughters before her death in Dec 47: see PIlgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 5, <hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>; not given in Stonehouse however</note> that stands among my books.a Do not think me remiss in not having written to you sooner, for aI have been too unwell to do much.4a</p>
<p>My daughters (the younger of whom is married) beg me to send you their kind regard. aIt is not very unlikely that I may have the pleasure of seeing you in Glasgow<note>CD gave readings there on 17, 19 Apr and 18 May 66; but they may not have met after all as Bell had suffered a bereavement: see To Bell, 19 Apr 66 (Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 11, p. 189 and n)</note> before long.a</p>
