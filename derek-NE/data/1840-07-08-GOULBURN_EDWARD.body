I am unfortunate again! I am engaged next Wednesday – not only to dinner at home, but to a party at Miss Coutts’s in the Evening.<note>CD had accepted Miss Coutts's invitation on 4 July: see <hi rend="italic">To</hi> Miss Coutts, 4 July, and To Marjoribanks, 6 July (Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 2, pp. 95-6).</note> I should have written to you sooner, but there was a chance of release from the first of these engagements, which, I am sorry to say exists no longer. I cannot tell you how vexed I am.
