I have always refused my consent when it has been a question as to the dramatization of my largest works. In this case I comply with much pleasure, and I trust your rendering of "Micawber”<note><hi rend="italic">Little Em’ly</hi>, adapted by Andrew Halliday; performed at the Olympic, London, in December 1869, and often revived; Rowe played the role of Micawber. For details see H. Philip Bolton, <hi rend="italic">Dickens Dramatized</hi>, 1987, pp. 328-9. See also Malcolm Morley, 'Stage Appearances of Copperfield', <hi rend="italic">Dickensian</hi> 49 (1953): 77-85, in which he notes 'Dickens expressed his great satisfaction with the production' (p. 79).</note> may be as successful as your "Lavater”<note>J.R. Planché’s two-act comic drama, <hi rend="italic">Lavater the Physiognomist</hi>, or, Not a Bad Judge.</note> which I witnessed the other evening.
