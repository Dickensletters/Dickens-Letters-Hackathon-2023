Both Mrs. Dickens and I are exceedingly indebted to you for your kind letter, and wish it were in our power to accept your hospitable invitation, which it would give us great pleasure to do. But we have arranged with some friends to be down at the Seaside all August and September, and we are, therefore, not at our own disposal.
