Will you do me the new kindness to see what is the matter with the Bearer of this note, Mr. Wilson,<note>William Wilson, theatrical hairdresser and wig-maker, 277 Strand; see Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 6, p. 394n.</note> Perruquier to all the chief Theatres in London, of whom I have had much knowledge in our Amateur Plays, and who is a very worthy and zealous man—not gaining much, by great exertion—quite an artist in his way—most attentive, punctual, steady, and reliable in all things. He is certainly in want of sound medical advice, and I can recommend him (but that’s little to say) to none so sound and kind as yours.<note>Wilson was well enough in Dec 50 to be engaged for the Rockingham theatricals, Jan 51 (<hi rend="italic">To</hi> Mrs Watson, 14 Dec 50, Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 6, p. 34).</note>
