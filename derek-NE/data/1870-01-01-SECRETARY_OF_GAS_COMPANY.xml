         <p>I am very unwilling to complain; but the gas supplied me within this last fortnight has been so intolerably bad, that the taking of it from the Company at all has been merely an expensive form. It has been black in colour, and so scant in quantity, that I have been obliged to burn a large number of wax candles to obtain any adequate light in my hall and Billiard room. At this season, of all others, the inconvenience has been very great, and it has become necessary that I should strongly represent it to you</p>
