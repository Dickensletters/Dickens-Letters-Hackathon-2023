         <p>I have read with great satisfaction the excellent project you have communicated to me for the establishment of Drawing Schools for Artisans, and have the utmost pleasure in consenting to be one of the proposed committee.<note>Public interest in the organisation of artisan drawing education was stimulated by the Great Exhibition, and the 1851 Drawing School Committee was re-formed in 1852 with 13 members, including the Earl of Carlisle, Henry Cole and CD. See David Jerome, 'General Notes', <hi rend="italic">Journal of the Royal Society of Arts</hi>, 117 (April 1969): 365-7.</note></p>
