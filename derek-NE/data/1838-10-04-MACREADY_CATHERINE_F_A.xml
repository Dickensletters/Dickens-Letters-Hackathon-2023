         <p>I very much regret that most pressing, more solitary, and less agreeable engagements prevent my having the pleasure of dining with you tomorrow. I should apologize for not answering your kind note before, but Kate<note>Catherine Dickens, née Hogarth (1815-79), CD's wife.
</note> was taken so very unwell yesterday morning that she was compelled to go to bed – and hence the delay. She is better to-day and sends her best regards to yourself and Miss<note>Letitia Margaret (1794-1858), W.C. Macready's sister, who lived with them.</note> and Mr. Macready, in which I heartily join.</p>
<p>I have had the resolution to shut myself up so strictly with Oliver Twist, as not to enter the doors of Covent Garden Theatre since the opening night,<note>W.C. Macready, as manager of Covent Garden Theatre, opened the new season on 24 Sept 1838 with Shakespeare's Coriolanus, ceding the title role to John Vandenhoff.</note> despite Hamlet and Othello.<note><hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Othello</hi> were being performed alternately from 1 Oct. CD incorporated motifs from <hi rend="italic">Othello</hi> into part 21 of Oliver Twist, which he was then writing: in chapter 47 Bill Sikes rushes to murder Nancy after Iago-like goading by Fagin. See Laurence Senelick, "Traces of Othello in Oliver Twist," <hi rend="italic">Dickensian</hi> 70.2 (1974): 98-100.</note> What do you think of that?</p>
