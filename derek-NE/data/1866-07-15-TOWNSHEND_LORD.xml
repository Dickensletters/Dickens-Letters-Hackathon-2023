         <p>I regret that I cannot have the pleasure of dining with Lady Townshend<note>Lady Anne Elizabeth Clementina (1847-1925), daughter of James (Duff) 5th Earl of Fife; they married 17 Oct 65.</note> and yourself on the Seventeenth, as I have left town for the Season and have family visitors here. Your kind note reached me only today, in consequence of my having been on a ramble.<note> There are no letters between 11 and 15 July; CD may have been with his lover Ellen Ternan.
</note> Let me assure you that your remembrance was very welcome to me</p>
