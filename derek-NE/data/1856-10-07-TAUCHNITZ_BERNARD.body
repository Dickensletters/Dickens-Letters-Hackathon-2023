I have safely received your draft at eight days after date for £50 sterling.<note>This is one of the few instances where a £50 payment by Tauchnitz, intended for the Household Words account with Coutts &amp; Co., ended up in CD's personal bank account; for other instances see <hi rend="italic">To</hi> Tauchnitz, 31 March 1852 and 8 April 1856.  The phrase "draft at eight days" refers to the fact that Tauchnitz's bill could be cashed by CD eight days after the date stated on the bill, thus allowing time for the necessary funds to be transferred to the account on which the bill is drawn.</note1856> Allow me to acknowledge its receipt, with thanks.
