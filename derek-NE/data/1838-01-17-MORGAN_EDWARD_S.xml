In his "Brief Retrospect", 1873 (MS University of Illinois), Morgan claimed the credit for first noticing CD's originality and for persuading Bentley to negotiate with him. There is no evidence to support this; but Morgan was certainly in Bentley's confidence.</note> [17 OR 24 JANUARY 1838]</title>

See Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 1, pp. 252, 265, 354 and nn.</note> paper, in consequence of its arriving so late in the month, I return it as you desire. Will you be good enough to leave instructions in the office that if "Aliquis"<note>Unidentified; clearly a pseudonym.</note> or anybody else sends about papers offered for the Miscellany, the reply is that his communication will be answered on the last day of the month?<note><hi rend="italic">Bentley’s Miscellany</hi> was published on the last day of the month. The issue published 31 January 1838 included "Notices to Correspondents", listing the authors whose articles were rejected (among them “Aliquis”).</note></p>
