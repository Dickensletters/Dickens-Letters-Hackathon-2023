Let me thank you heartily for your elegant volume<note><hi rend="italic">A Vision of Deathâ€™s Destruction, and Other Poems</hi>, 1839 (3rd edn). The 1844 Devonshire Terrace Inventory lists two copies of poems by Ouseley (Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 4, p. 713); Ouseley sent CD an inscribed copy of Poems, 1870 (<hi rend="italic">Catalogue of the Library of CD</hi>, ed. J.H.Stonehouse, 1935).</note> and for your dedication of it to myself. Let me thank you too for the more than pleasure I have derived from the perusal of it, and for the delight it has afforded me. I should have acknowledged the receipt of your kind communication sooner, but that I am residing out of town for the Summer and only receive letters and parcels from London now and then. This was the cause of some delay before it reached me, and I was unwilling to write to you until I had read your book.
