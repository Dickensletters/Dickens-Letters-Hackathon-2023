            <title><hi rend="italic">To</hi> MISS J___ D___,<note>Unidentified; but Miss D____'s first initial is revealed in To Miss J____ D____, 17 June 1839. <hi rend="italic">The Glasgow Evening Citizen</hi> expands on the history of the addressee: "Miss D____ got back to Glasgow, where she was married, and in such a position of comfort, that on Mr. Dickens's first visit to this city [in July 1841], she found him out, and desired him to accept repayment of the sums he had advanced, at which, in her own simple phrase, 'he only laughed.' Now [1870], however, somewhat advanced in years, her husband completely invalided, and herself broken down in health, she is again in need of aid. These original letters of Mr. Dickens, which she has so long treasured, she is now anxious to dispose of to any benevolent admirer of the distinguished author, and it will afford a curious illustration of the fruitfulness of good actions, if they should prove, once more, a source of hope and relief, to one who seems a thoroughly deserving, if a somewhat romantic and unfortunate person. The letters may be seen at our office."</note> 14 DECEMBER 1839</title>
