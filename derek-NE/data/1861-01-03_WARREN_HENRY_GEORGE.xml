            <salute>Dear Sir</salute>
         </opener>
         <p>I am exceedingly glad to find that the Committee of the Newspaper Press Fund<note>Founded June 1858 by the Parliamentary reporters of London newspapers, to relieve members or families of deceased members of the Fund. Opposed by <hi rend="italic">The Times</hi>, it had not prospered so far.</note> agree with me in the main, as to the [ ]<note>“exp” deleted by CD.</note> inexpediency of holding a public dinner, in the present condition of that Society.<note>See To Warren, 19 Dec 60, Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 9, p. 360.</note> I beg you to assure them that I shall be heartily at their service, when the case for a public appeal may seem to all of us more hopeful. The reason you assign in partial explanation of the scanty list of subscribers who belong to the daily press, is undoubtedly entitled to its full weight. I had taken it into account (having heard of those changes in the system), before I wrote to you. Allow me to enclose a small subscription<note>After CD’s letter had been read, it was ordered that he be thanked for his “handsome donation” of £10 (CD’s Account-book, MS Messrs Coutts) and the expression of his sympathy for the Fund in his letters of 19 Dec 60 and 3 Jan 61 (Newspaper Press Fund Minute Book, 12 Jan 61).</note> with my best wishes.</p>
