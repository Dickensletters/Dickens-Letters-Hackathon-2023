Here follow the heads of a little agreement I want drawn up in due form between myself and Chapman and Hall.<note>The text of the agreement (dated 1 Feb 1870) for <hi rend="italic">Edwin Drood</hi>, between CD, Frederic Chapman and Henry Merivale Trollope (son of the novelist Anthony Trollope, who owned a one-third interest in Chapman &amp; Hall) is reprinted in Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 12, pp. 720-1. See also To Frederic Chapman, 20 Aug 1869, in Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 12, p. 398, for CDâ€™s proposal to his publisher for a new story in twelve monthly numbers.</note> I suppose it had best be a separate agreement, apart from that which you now have in hand?<note>For the agreement between CD and Chapman &amp; Hall for Our Mutual Friend, see Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 11, pp. 477-8.</note> But you will know all about that.
