         <p>Many thanks for your kind and handsome letter. I have made its tenor known to Mr Ouvry,<note>Frederic Ouvry (1814-81), CD's solicitor from 1856. See To Ouvry, [?10 May 1858], Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 8, p. 562, for mention of this letter.</note> and will write to you again when I am in possession of his opinion.<note>CD proposed that Ouvry seek an amendment of the Act of Parliament incorporating the Guild of Literature and Art, to enable the Guild to accept a gift of Hawkesbury Hall in Warwickshire from Fraser. See Michael Slater, "Munificence Declined: New Letters about the Guild of Literature and Art", <hi rend="italic">Dickensian</hi> 111.1 (2015): 34-41</note></p>
