         <p>...Mrs. Atwood<note>Mrs Montgomery Atwood, agent for the New York publisher Benjamin Wood (see <hi rend="italic">To</hi> Benjamin Wood, [Aug-8 Oct 67]); based in London and Paris.</note> presented herself to me as the Agent of a certain man in New York, who wanted to buy a short story<note>“George Silverman’s Explanation”.</note> of me for a Thousand Pounds. I agreed to write it. When the story was ready, the thousand pounds were not.<note>CD agreed with Mrs Atwood (27 Feb 67) and confirmed with Wood (9 Apr 67) that he would write a story for £1,000, the MS to be ready by 1 Aug. CD had stipulated that the fee be deposited with a London bank and exchanged for the sealed MS.</note> When Mr. Dolby went to America before me,<note>George Dolby went to America to prepare for CD’s 1867 reading tour. He took CD’s MS, but was not satisfied Wood intended to pay and withheld the story: see further Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 11, p. 450n.</note> I gave him the story, and charged him to see the man. This he did, and the money was produced. But the man claiming a right<note>The right not identified. In To Wood, 9 Apr 67 CD specifies the fee, delivery of the MS, and that the story was “to become yours on the consideration mentioned in my communication to Mrs. Atwood”: the “consideration”, as To Mrs Atwood, 27 Feb 67, makes clear, was the £1,000 fee.</note> which I had never in the least intended to sell him, Mr. Dolby withheld the story and declined to take the money. I then (disposing of the story elsewhere)<note>To Atlantic Monthly, 3 parts, Jan-Mar 68; reprinted in All the Year Round, 1, 15 and 29 Feb 68, XIX, 180, 228 and 276.</note> wrote to the man that he had broken his conditions and I would have nothing to do with him.... Mrs. Atwood’s astraightforward manner testified that the conditions were unquestionably broken by her principal, and that I was right. I had before that time presented her to Victor Hugo;<note>Victor Marie Hugo (1802-85), poet and novelist. CD first met him in Jan 47 (Pilgrim Letters 5, p. 15 & nn). CD helped to facilitate Mrs Atwood’s affairs with Hugo (Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 11, p. 388).</note> and I was so satisfied of her good faith,<note>CD fully exonerated Mrs Atwood, assuring her he had “the highest opinion” of her rectitude (8 Oct 67; Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 11, p. 450).</note> that I did not think it necessary to caution Hugo regarding the person for whom she had negotiated.  </p>
