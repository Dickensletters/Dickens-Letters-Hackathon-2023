I enclose a cheque for £45, the amount of the Passage Money.<note>The cheque was not paid to Georgiana Morson directly, as it was for tickets to Australia for Emma Spencer, Ellen Glyn and Rosina Newman, three residents of Urania Cottage (see Jenny Hartley, <hi rend="italic">Charles Dickens and the House of Fallen Women</hi> [Methuen, 2009], p. 219); they left on the Duke of Bedford, which left Gravesend on 29 Oct 1851 (<hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, 30 Oct 1851, p. 7), and arrived in Melbourne on 4 Feb 1852. On 13 Aug 1851, CD asked W. H. Wills to track down the Registrar of Merchant Seamen and enquire about emigrant ships bound for Australia on which the discipline would be suitable for girls from Urania Cottage (Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 6, p. 459). That Registrar was Lieut. John Hoskins Brown, to whom CD wrote on 4 October, asking how Mrs Morson should pay for the three passages that Lieut. Brown had reserved. On 13 October, Dickens paid £45 to "Fry &amp; Co." (Fry &amp; Davison, ship and insurance agents, 113 Fenchurch Street).  A voyage from London to Sydney in steerage cost £15-20. On the same day CD wrote to Angela Burdett Coutts, the benefactor of Urania Cottage, to confirm that the passage money was paid.</note>
