Royal Emigrant’s Almanack Concerning Five Years Servitude under the Hudson’s Bay Company (n.d.): see Pilgrim Letters 11, p. 213 n.4. For CD’s warm if qualified response, see To Melrose, 11 June 1866 (Pilgrim Letters 11, p. 213).</note> Do me the justice to believe that I should have done so sooner, but that both favors have only reached me just now on my return to my own home.<note>CD had been largely out of London on his Spring reading tour, April-May (see Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 11, p. 533).</note>
