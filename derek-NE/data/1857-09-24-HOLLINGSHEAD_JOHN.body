 I am doubtful as to the Twenty Shillings in the Pound, and should like to take time to consider it.<note>"Twenty Shillings in the Pound", which described dishonest business practices, was eventually accepted, and published in <hi rend="italic">Household Words</hi> 16 (7 Nov 1857): 444-6. See <hi rend="italic">To</hi> John Hollingshead, 4 Oct 1857.</note>
