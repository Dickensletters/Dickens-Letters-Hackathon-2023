Cruikshank and Phiz provided the illustrations.</note> and the Farce.<note>"The Lamplighter's Story", which CD had originally conceived as a farce for the actor William Charles Macready, who had rejected it (see Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 1: 465); it was eventually converted to a prose narrative and published as the lead story in the first volume of <hi rend="italic">The Pic Nic Papers</hi> (1: 1-32).</note> When you have decided on the subject from the latter, will you let me know, in order that I may keep the Text as you desire?<note>Cruikshank produced the illustration "The Philosopher's Stone" to accompany "The Lamplighter's Story".</note>
