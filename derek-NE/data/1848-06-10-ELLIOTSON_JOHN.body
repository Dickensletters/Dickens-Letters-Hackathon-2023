     I am deeply sorry to receive the intelligence you send me of the Brave Courier,<note>Louis Roche, who accompanied CD on his visit to Italy in 1844-45, and to Switzerland in 1846; described in <hi rend="italic">Pictures from Italy</hi> as "a French Courier â€“ best of servants and most beaming of men!"</note> who is one of the gentlest and most genial natures in the world
