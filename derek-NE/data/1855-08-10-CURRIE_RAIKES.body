I was very sorry to have missed you and Gowran Vernon<note>The Hon Gowran Charles Vernon (1825-72), barrister, second son of Robert Vernon Smith, of Farming Woods, Thrapston, Northants, MP for Northampton from 1831 until 1859, when he was raised to the peerage as Baron Lyveden; Vernon's father was the son of "Bobus" Smith and nephew of Sydney, took the name of Vernon only, already authorized by Royal Licence for his issue in 1845. Gowran Vernon played Tom Saville in <hi rend="italic">Used Up</hi>, and Lord Rivers in <hi rend="italic">A Day after the Wedding</hi>. Gowan in <hi rend="italic">Little Dorrit</hi> was first called "Gowran".</note> (to whom I beg my kind regards) to day. After a morning’s work, I was ravaging the Downs at a great pedestrian rate when you called. I am anxious to say in explanation of the enclosed note,<note>Presumably from Mrs CD, declining Currie’s invitation.
