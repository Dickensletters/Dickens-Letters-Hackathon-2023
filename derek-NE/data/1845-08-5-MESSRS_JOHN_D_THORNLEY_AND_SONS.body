I beg to acknowledge the safe receipt of your enclosure, on behalf of our friend Mr. Colden of New York,<note>David Cadwallader Colden (1797-1850), American lawyer and philanthropist: see further Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 3, p. 30n. CD had first met him in England, summer 1840. Colden, in London, May 45, and still there in July (Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 4, pp. 310, 334), presumably could draw on Thornelyâ€™s and used CD as a secure address.</note> of a bank note for Twenty Pounds, No. 55944.
