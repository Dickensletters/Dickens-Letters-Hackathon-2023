         <p>I have received your obliging letter with the greatest astonishment, for I am perfectly sure that I am no party to any misunderstanding with Monsieur Philarete Charles,<note>Thus in MS. Victor Euphémion Philarète Chasles (1798-1873), French critic, journalist and man of letters. Sent to London 1815, where he worked for the printer Abraham John Valpy on editions of classical authors. Wrote articles for the English reviews, and on his return to France in 1818 did much to popularise the reading of English authors. Contributed to the <hi rend="italic">Revue des deux mondes, Revue britannique, and Journal des débats</hi>. Librarian of the Bibliothèque Mazarine 1837-73, and Professor of comparative literature at the Collège de France 1841-73.</note> and I cannot even remember that I have ever had the honor of communicating with that respected gentleman. On this last head however I may possibly be mistaken. If so, I do not doubt that you will have the kindness to set me right. </p>
<p>If I should not find you at home when I call with this, I will arrange to be here at half past five to day.</p>
