I have seen the girl,<note>Unidentified.</note> respecting whom you wrote to me, and I give her this letter. I have taken down such unsatisfactory particulars as it is possible from the very nature of her life to get out of her, and should like to know – must indeed, before it is possible to admit her – that her story is so far true. As it is close by you, I wish you would enquire (taking her with you if you like) at Mrs. Crouch’s<note>Matilda Crouch, lodging house keeper, 28 Tavistock Place</note> – at the Turnham Green Hall<note>Unidentified; Turnham Green itself, in Chiswick, borders on Heathfield Terrace and Chiswick High Road.</note> – and at the place where she lodged – and ascertain that these are facts. If her statement appears to be untrue, no more can be done for her. If it appearsto be true, you may give her a shilling or two today: and if you will come to me tomorrow morning and tell me what you have discovered, I will at once decide upon the case without waiting to refer it to Miss Coutts.
