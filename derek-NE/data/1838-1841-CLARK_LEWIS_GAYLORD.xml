            <title>To LEWIS GAYLORD CLARK,<note>Lewis Gaylord Clark (1808-73; <hi rend="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</hi>), editor and controlling proprietor (1834- 60) of the <hi rend="italic">Knickerbocker</hi>, 1833-65: Clark made it one of the leading American journals (Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 1, pp. 431 <hi rend="italic">n</hi>.1, 469 <hi rend="italic">n</hi>.2). CD later recalled dining with him in America, Feb 42, while reverting to his unfulfilled promise to contribute to the <hi rend="italic">Knickerbocker</hi> (To Clark, 2 Mar 43, Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 3, p. 451). Given Clark's garbling elsewhere of CD’s correspondence (Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 3, p. 451 n.4), the present extract is quite probably a composite from different sources, including To Messrs Wiley &amp; Putnam, 13 Dec [38], agents in London for the Knickerbocker, where the phrase “which I read with very great pleasure” also occurs (Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 1, p. 469).</note> [?1838-1841]</title>

         <p>I read the Knickerbocker with very great pleasure: it is indeed a most various and entertaining periodical. It will afford me pleasure to contribute to the pages of a work which numbers among its regular correspondents such writers as Washington Irving.<note>Washington Irving (1783-1859; <hi rend="italic">Dictionary of American Biography</hi>), American author; member of the American Legation in Spain (1826) and London (1829); Minister in Spain, 1842. His works include a comic history of New York, “by Diedrich Knickerbocker” (1809), a pen name he frequently used and taken as title of the magazine, to which he was a frequent contributor; <hi rend="italic">The Sketchbook of Geoffrey Crayon</hi>, Gent (1820), which includes “Rip Van Winkle” and “The Legend of Sleepy Hollow”; and Legends of the Alhambra (1832). Greatly admired by CD: see <hi rend="italic">To</hi> Irving, 21 Apr 41 (Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 2, pp. 267-9).</note></p>
