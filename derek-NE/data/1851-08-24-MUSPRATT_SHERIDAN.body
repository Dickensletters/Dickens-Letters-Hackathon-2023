Muspratt had worked in his laboratory, 1843. Liebig was making a tour through the United Kingdom</note> – one of the greatest men in Europe, and in whom I am (as who is not?) most strongly interested. But I can only feel proud at a distance, to know that I have the honor to number him among my readers.
