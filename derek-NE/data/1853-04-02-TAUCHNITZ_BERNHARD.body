I perfectly agree in all the suggestions you so kindly make in your letter, as to paying Dr Müller.<note>Professor O. C. Müller, 6 Tauchaer Strasse, Leipzig, a schoolmaster with whom CD's son Charley (1837-96) lived for six months in 1853, in order to learn German. See To Angela Burdett Coutts, 1 Apr 1853, Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 7, p. 56. Charley's stay at Leipzig was paid for by Dickens's friend and benefactor Angela Burdett Coutts. The overall cost was c. £300; see <hi rend="italic">To</hi> Angela Burdett Coutts, 15 Jan 1854 &amp;amp; 2 March 1855, Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 7, pp. 244, 553. Tauchnitz paid Charley's expenses locally and deducted the amount from payments due on account from Tauchnitz to CD. The only payments made by CD directly for Charley's German expenses were one for £25 on 28 February 1853, shown in the bank ledger of Coutts &amp; Co. as "Germany", and one for £5 on 2 March 1853, listed as "Charles's sundries".</note> If you will have the goodness to do as you propose, I shall be very much obliged to you.
