         <p>I beg to assure you that I have been greatly interested in your letter, and by the papers you have kindly sent me.<note> Presumably regarding the fundraising effort to move the Institution from Southwark to Redhill; a public subscription was opened in Jan 1848.
</note> If so short a notice had found me disengaged, I would certainly have come to the Dinner on Saturday.<note>The Institution held an annual Anniversary Dinner on 26 Feb 1848 at the London Tavern, Bishopsgate Street. Viscount Morpeth presided (<hi rend="italic">Morning Chronicle</hi>, 28 Feb 1848, p.3).</note> But I am hopelessly bound to another good work ofa ba less public and extensive interest,<note>Urania Cottage, the home for homeless women in Shepherd’s Bush, founded in 1847, which housed former prostitutes, criminals and destitute girls. CD played an active role, overseeing the house with Angela Burdett Coutts. For CD’s account of Urania Cottage, see his article "Home for Homeless Women", <hi rend="italic">Household Words</hi> 7 (23 April 1853): 169-75. See also Jenny Hartley, <hi rend="italic">Charles Dickens and the House of Fallen Women</hi> (London: Methuen, 2009).</note> and cannot possibly do so. . . <hi rend="italic">he also tells</hi> Turner that he is much occupied just now, and shall be, until about the twenty fifth of March,<note>CD was occupied with <hi rend="italic">Dombey and Son</hi>, which he completed in late Mar 1848.</note><hi rend="italic">but should be happy to visit his institution at some later time.b</hi></p>
