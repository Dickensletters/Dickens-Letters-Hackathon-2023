I regret to assure you that my ability to be useful to the incredible numbers of my unknown correspondents, halts very—very—far short of my inclination. I can really do absolutely nothing for your husband’s compositions, beyond myself reading any that you may offer for insertion in these pages, honestly and attentively, and with a sincere desire to make some of them profitable to him, if I can. But I need scarcely tell you that I can only have that satisfaction in the event of their being suitable to the requirements of this Journal.
