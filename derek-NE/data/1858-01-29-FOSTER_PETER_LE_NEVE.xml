         <p>I cannot have the honor of being one of the Deputation to present the address to which your Private Circular refers;<note>A Deputation of members of the Society of Arts presented a congratulatory address to the Prince Consort (President of the Society), on the occasion of the marriage of his daughter, the Princess Royal, to Prince Frederick William of Prussia on 25 January 1858; see <hi rend="italic">Journal of the Society of Arts</hi> no 273, Vol. 6 (12 Feb 1858): 183.</note> inasmuch as I attached my name to it as President of the Chatham and Rochester Institution, in submission to such of its members as have appended their names to the document, and without in the least perceiving (as I informed the Secretary), what on earth we had to do with the marriage of the Princess Royal.</p>
