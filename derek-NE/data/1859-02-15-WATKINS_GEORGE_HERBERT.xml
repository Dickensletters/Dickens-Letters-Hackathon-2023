            <salute>My Dear Mr. Watkins </salute>
         </opener>
         <p>I am exceedingly obliged to you for your kind and handsome letter. Pray accept my cordial thanks.</p>
<p>The best edition of my books (which is called The Library Edition) is now in course of publication. The Publisher will immediately send you all the Volumes that are out,<note>14 out of the 22 vols had been published by mid-Feb, the latest being Dombey and Son, 2 vols.</note> and an additional volume every month. Please consider these, as a set in their working clothes for common use. When the Edition is completed, I shall hope to send you another set, in bright holiday costume.</p>
<p>I have gone through the highly interesting scenes<note>Unidentified. As Watkins was predominantly a portraitist it is difficult to ascertain what CD means here.</note> I return with this, and venture to enclose a list of a dozen that I should like to have. I hope I am not encroaching too much on your liberality and good nature. </p>
<p>Herbert Watkins Esquire </p>
