I send you a little fan today which I hope you will like—if not for its sake, for mine. I tried one with the legend, in spangles, “I am not the Humbug some people call me”—but it didn’t look well!<note>Clearly a running joke between CD and Lady Olliffe (compare <hi rend="italic">To</hi> Lady Olliffe, 26 May 61, Pilgrim Letters 9, p. 421), though probably symptomatic of CD’s increasing awareness of charges of humbug and lachrymose sentiment directed against him in the 1850s and 1860s. In April 1851, when CD chaired the General Theatrical Fund dinner (the night his daughter Dora died) and Forster, proposing his health, declared that CD’s “practical philanthropy was ever palpable”, someone had “cried out ‘Humbug!’” (<hi rend="italic">Daily News</hi>, 15 April 51, quoted in <hi rend="italic">The Speeches of CD</hi>, ed. K.J.Fielding, 1960, p.124). This hostility was to find open expression in the tributes to Thackeray (early 1864), who was contrasted with “writers of the Gushing School” (Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 10, p. 347<hi rend="italic">n</hi>).</note> I am very sorry to tell you that in the awful confiscation of private papers that always goes on here, the total papers from Cork<note>The subject of the papers not traced; some parts were found (<hi rend="italic">To</hi> Olliffe, [13] Apr 61 and <hi rend="italic">To</hi> Lady Olliffe, 13 Apr 61 (Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 9, p. 403).</note> were destroyed. I hope you will get Olliffe’s forgiveness for me. He had described their contents as they concerned his good brother <note>Henry B. Olliffe, J.P., Secretary to Cork, Blackrock and Passage Railway Co., of Mount Verdon House, 66 Summer Hill, Cork. He had offered hospitality when CD visited the city on his 1858 reading tour: see Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 8, p.637.</note>with such astonishing exactness, that he can’t want them.
