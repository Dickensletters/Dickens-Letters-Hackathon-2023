I have given your instructions, envelope, and stamps, to the publisher here<note>Chapman AND Hall; possibly an offprint from <hi rend="italic">All the Year Round</hi> was requested.</note> (having nothing to do with that kind of business myself), and no doubt the commission will be faithfully executed by to day’s post. Your letter is exceedingly pleasant to me, and I thank you for it most cordially. It is my misfortune to believe America short of absolute perfection, and sometimes to think that she vitally injures the great principles she holds in trust;<note>As embodied in the Declaration of Independence. CD had experienced the tyranny of the Press, hostility for his claims to copyright protection, and the institution of slavery: see <hi rend="italic">American Notes</hi>, Martin <hi rend="italic">Chuzzlewit</hi>, and Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 3, throughout and pp. 125 viii-xvi. Mrs Von Oppen’s birthplace and the company her husband worked for suggest grounds for objection to CD’s representation of the United States.</note> but I have numbers of American friends, and I believe I have never lost one by reason of this moral audacity. So I send my regard with some confidence to your husband, and assure you that I remain what I have so long been without knowing it—
