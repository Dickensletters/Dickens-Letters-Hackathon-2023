Most of the statements in Mr Bowen Mayâ€™s letter<note>James Bowen May (1813-99). Solicitor, of Bolton House, 67 Russell Square. He wrote to CD on 10 Feb 1866</note> are absolutely false. I never was threatened with legal proceedings by Kings &amp;amp; Co.<note>W. Kings &amp;amp; Co., of 100-101 Long Acre, Drury Lane, manufacturer of miniature broughams.</note> I paid for a brougham I bought of them at the very time the money was due for it.<note>The brougham was in fact purchased by W.H. Wills.</note> I had cause of complaint against them; but never refused to pay them one shilling of repairs which they demanded of me.
