I am exceedingly sorry to say, in reply to your note, that it is quite out of my power to give you the employment you seek. I believe my publishers facilitate the German translations<note>For translations up to 1841, see Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 2, p. 43<hi rend="italic">n</hi>.</note> of my writings, by sending early sheets to certain German Booksellers.<note>Publishers of translations included Weber and Wigand of Leipzig, Franckh and Krabbe of Stuttgart, and Vieweg of Brunswick: see Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 4 p. 17n.</note> But this is matter of arrangement between them. The books are translated in Germany; and the enterprise is not mine, or my publishers, but originated with German houses of business.
