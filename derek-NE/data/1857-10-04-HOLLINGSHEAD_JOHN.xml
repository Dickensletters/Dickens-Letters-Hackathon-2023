            <title><hi rend="italic">To</hi> JOHN HOLLINGSHEAD,<note>John Hollingshead (1827-1904; <hi rend="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</hi>), journalist and, later, theatre manager. After working as a clerk and commercial traveller, became a prolific contributor to periodicals; wrote for <hi rend="italic">Punch, the Leader</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Cornhill, the Train</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Household Words</hi> and <hi rend="italic">All the Year Round</hi>, and many others. For a time dramatic critic on the Daily News. Contributed regularly to <hi rend="italic">Household Words</hi> from Oct 1857; became a member of the journal's staff 1859. He greatly admired CD: in <hi rend="italic">My Lifetime</hi> (London: Sampson Low, Marston &amp; Co, 1895) he includes himself among the "Dickens young men" (I, 96) and refers to CD as "the master" (I, 97); but stresses that he did not imitate CD and that CD very rarely altered his articles (I, 96). Hollingshead later became manager of the Gaiety Theatre 1868-86, and Director of several Music Hall companies; he is credited with bringing Gilbert and Sullivan together for the first time in 1871.</note> 4 OCTOBER 1857 </title>

         </opener>
         <p> I don't think there is enough in this paper,<note>Unidentified; Hollingshead contributed numerous pieces to <hi rend="italic">Household Words</hi> from October 1857 onward.</note> to separate it from some other similar narratives (more or less), that have appeared in Household Words. Twenty Shillings in the pound, I with pleasure retain for insertion.<note>"Twenty Shillings in the Pound", which described dishonest business practices, was published in <hi rend="italic">Household Words</hi> 16 (7 Nov 1857): 444-6. See also <hi rend="italic">To</hi> John Hollingshead, 24 Sep 1857.</note></p>
