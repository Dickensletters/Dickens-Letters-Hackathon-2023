 I have not sent your note to Mrs. Talfourd,<note><note>(1795-1854; <hi rend="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</hi>), barrister and writer: see Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 1, pp. 290n, 315<hi rend="italic">n</hi>. CD had first met Talfourd in Spring 1837; the arrangements proposed support a date when CD knew the Talfourds well</note></note> for I found on reflection that I could not possibly dine out on Monday – or indeed sooner than Saturday,<note>Throughout Spring 1838 CD was editing <hi rend="italic">Bentley’s Miscellany</hi>, writing <hi rend="italic">Oliver Twist</hi>, and planning and writing <hi rend="italic">Nicholas Nickleby</hi>: he clearly needed ten days to complete his stint before a deadline of the 19th of the month.</note> having in mind my work. Will you say how much pleasure it will afford me to dine in Russell Square on that day, if convenient?
