         <p>My Dear Mr. Hill—I call you “Mr.” because you are such a veteran, though my inclination is to drop any word that seems to imply any formality between us, and assume the most irreverential familiarity of address. I cannot tell you how much pleasure I have derived from your kind note, and how cheering it is to me to be assured of the friendly interest of one whom I so warmly and truly esteem.<note>Presumably Hill had congratulated CD on <hi rend="italic">The Old Curiosity Shop</hi>; he attended the dinner (20 Oct) to celebrate completion of Vol.1 of <hi rend="italic">Master Humphrey’s Clock</hi>. He died on 20 Dec, after a fall.</note> I receive your congratulations with true gratification, for I know they are sincere and am proud of a place in your kind recollection and warm heart.</p>
<p>Carry with you to Paris and bring back again, my earnest and hearty friendship. Be a reader as long as I am a writer, and let us hope that we may regard each other with the same feelings as those which<note>“those which” written above caret.</note> animate<note>Final “s” deleted.</note> us now, in some other world where if there will be very few books, there will be (if my faith be at all near the right one) marvellously few booksellers.</p>
