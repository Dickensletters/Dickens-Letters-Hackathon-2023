 I have this morning received your letter herewith safely, and am truly glad to have it.<note>CD had a “mistake” concerning Palfrey (untraced) brought to his attention by his Boston publisher and close friend, James T. Fields, on 19 Dec 1867 (Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 11 p. 515-16). The note “astounded” CD, who was clearly worried that the error could be interpreted by Palfrey as by “intention and design”. He met with Palfrey on 22 Dec while in Boston for two nights of readings, and returned to New York on 25 Dec 1867.</note> Will you kindly present my compliments to Miss Palfrey,<note>Sarah Hammond Palfrey (1823-1914).</note> and tell her that I have not forgotten a line or two of direction I am to write for her when I next come to Boston<note>Thus in MS (no full stop).</note>
