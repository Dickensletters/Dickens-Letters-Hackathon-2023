            <title><hi rend="italic">To</hi> SIR THOMAS NOON TALFOURD,<note>Thomas Noon Talfourd (1795-1854; <hi rend="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</hi>), barrister (later Judge), MP, essayist, and dramatist. "What an extraordinary, what an indefatigable man!" wrote Macready, on first hearing of his tragedy Ion (Diaries, I, 219). As literary executor, published <hi rend="italic">Letters of Charles Lamb, with a Sketch of his Life</hi>, 1837, and <hi rend="italic">Final Memorials of Charles Lamb</hi>, 1848. Serjeant-at-Law 1833; Whig MP for his native town of Reading 1835-41 and 1847-9. CD reported him in Parliament and the Law Courts (e.g. in Norton v. Melbourne).

         <p>Will you kindly read the enclosed letter, which comes from the very best man in America -- the Greek Professor at their Cambridge University<note>Not identified and unknown to CD. Clearly Talfourd was enquiring about a letter he had received.</note> -- and write me a word in<note> Thus in MS.
</note> two in reply? My address is Knotsford Lodge, Great Malvern -- for Mrs. Dickens<note>Catherine Dickens, née Hogarth (1815-79).</note> is there for her health, and I am with her, except on one day in the week.<note>CD's wife remained at Malvern for treatment from 13 March to 15 April 1851; CD stayed with her at Knotsford, with visits to London.</note></p>
<p>As I remember—but not distinctly—this same mysterious gentleman gave some one a letter of introduction to me sometime since. To whom I plainly said that I knew no such person. In the same dim manner I seem to remember the same thing happening with Carlyle.<note>Thus in MS. George William Howard, 7th Earl of Carlisle (1802-64; <hi rend="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</hi>). Spent a year in America and Canada 1842, where he met most of CD’s hosts there: see further Pilgrim Letters 3, p. 118n.</note></p>
