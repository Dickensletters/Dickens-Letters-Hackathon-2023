I hope the opportunity you desire<note>Presumably connected with Berger's professional prospects.</note> will present itself naturally, before very long. I cannot make an express appointment for the purpose just now, as I am quite uncertain whether I may not be called out of town Tomorrow or next day, with Charles,<note>Charles Culliford Boz Dickens ("Charley", 1837-96), CD's eldest son.</note> or on the business of placing him in some house of commerce.<note>Charley was eventually placed with the financial house of Baring Brothers, 8 Bishopsgate Street Within. See <hi rend="italic">To</hi> Angela Burdett Coutts, 12 &amp;amp; 21 Jan 1855, in Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 7, pp. 503, 508.</note> Besides which, I have – the Christmas holidays being over – a fortnight's arrear of appointments to clear off.<note>That evening, CD met with W.H. Wills and a Mr Ryland to discuss what was to be done with Charley (see Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 7, pp. 503-4). Over the next fortnight, CD’s appointments were primarily focused on the question of Charley’s future. He went to Wimbledon to see the Rev. John Matthew Brackenbury of Wimbledon School about his son Walter’s education (Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters </hi>7, p. 508), and met with a merchant, John Dillon on 24 Jan, presumably about Charley’s future (Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 7, p. 506). CD hints at other such meetings with merchants during this time; he was also engaged in editorial work for <hi rend="italic">Household Words</hi>.</note>
