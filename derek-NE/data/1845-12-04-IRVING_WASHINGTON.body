Captain Cunynghame<note>Thus in MS. Sir Arthur Augustus Thurlow Cunyngham (1812-84), who held the rank of Captain in the Buffs (3rd [East Kent] Regiment of Foot) in 1845; afterwards General.

You will like him very much, I am sure; and it will be a happiness to me to see some one who has been in recent communication with you â€“ as I hope he will have been, when he and I meet in England next Midsummer.
