            <p>Text from the <hi rend="italic">Daily News</hi>, 7 February 1853, p. 5|<hi rend="italic">Contradicting a report, quoted from The Derby Reporter<note>The offending article was reprinted from <hi rend="italic">The Derby and Chesterfield Reporter</hi>, in which it was published on 4 Feb. However, the story also appeared in the [Penzance] Cornish Telegraph on 2 Feb (crediting a ‘London Correspondent’ and dating it 31 Jan), the <hi rend="italic">Derbyshire Chronicle</hi> of 4 Feb, and the <hi rend="italic">Hull Advertiser and Exchange Gazette</hi> of 4 Feb. William F. Long suggests at least thirty-five other newspapers also carried the story, four of which pre-dated the <hi rend="italic">Derby Reporter</hi>. It was reprinted in the <hi rend="italic">Daily News</hi> on 5 Feb with attribution to the Derby Reporter: “Mr. CHARLES DICKENS has, with great liberality, presented a cheque for 300l. to Sergeant Field, a super-annuated officer of the detective police, upon whose information he founded several articles in <hi rend="italic">Household Words</hi>, relative to the detective system” (5 Feb 1853, p. 3).</note>, relating how £300 had been presented to Inspector Field,<note>Charles Frederick Field (?1805-74) began his career as a Bow Street runner; was chief inspector of Metropolitan detective police until 1851, then retired on "good-service pension", but continued to work for the police at Great Scotland Yard and also as private inquiry agent. For CD’s expedition with him and articles in <hi rend="italic">Household Words</hi>, see his letters to W. H. Wills of 12 July and 17 Sep 1850, Pilgrim Letters 6, pp. 130 and 172, and to Sir Edward Bulwer Lytton, 9 May 1851, Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 6, p. 380. His characteristics, depicted most vividly in CD’s Household Words article "On Duty with Inspector Field", contributed much to Inspector Bucket in <hi rend="italic">Bleak House</hi>.</note> late of the detective force. </hi></p>

         <p>The statement is unimportant to me, but as it might cast a slur on the conduct of a most excellent officer in the discharge of his duty, I beg you to do him the justice of contradicting it, on my assurance that it is one of the most extravagant inventions I have ever seen in my life, without a scrap of truth for its foundation.<note>See William F. Long, ‘Inspector Field and the Improbable Gift’, <hi rend="italic">Dickens Quarterly</hi> 30.1 (2013): 43-54. Long suggests it may have been Field himself who circulated the rumour: Field set himself up as a private detective in 1853, writing to Dickens in August to ask for help in promoting his new business (Long 48; 27 Aug 1853, Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 12, p. 652). However, as Long notes, the article incorrectly gives Field the title of ‘Sergeant’, and risked doing more harm to Field’s reputation than good.</note></p>
