            <title><hi rend="italic">To</hi> BERNHARD TAUCHNITZ,<note>Baron Bernhard Christian Tauchnitz (1816-95), publisher, of Leipzig. Born at Schleinitz; nephew of the publisher Karl Tauchnitz. Founded his own firm in Leipzig in 1837. The firm began its “Collection of British Authors” Sep 1841 with Bulwer Lytton’s <hi rend="italic">Pelham. Pickwick Papers, Oliver Twist, and American Notes</hi> had appeared before the end of 1842, and Nicholas Nickleby in June 1843. He and CD became friendly, and CD sent Charley to Leipzig to learn German (see below). According to John Forster, Tauchnitz always paid liberally. He wrote to Forster after CD’s death: “All Mr Dickens’s works have been published under agreement by me. My intercourse with him lasted nearly twenty-seven years. The first of his letters dates in October 1843, and his last at the close of March, 1870 [see <hi rend="italic">To</hi> Tauchnitz, 31 March 1870]. Our long relations were not only never troubled by the least disagreement, but were the occasion of most hearty personal feeling; and I shall never lose the sense of his kind and friendly nature. On my asking him his terms for Edwin Drood, he replied, ‘Your terms shall be mine.’” (John Forster, <hi rend="italic">The Life of Charles Dickens</hi>, ed. J.W.T. Ley [London: Cecil Palmer, 1928], p. 807n).</note> 8 OCTOBER 1855</title>

         <p> aMany thanks for your letter, which was perfectly plain, and written in far more scholarly English than your modesty can imagine.a

</p>
<p>I received your bill safely, for the balance of the half year's payment to Household Words.<note>CD’s banking records with Coutts &amp; Co. show a receipt of £23.16s.1d on 6 October 1855, listed as "By letter" (that is, any cheque, cash or other financial instrument deposited by post rather than brought to the bank in person).</note></p>
<p>You shall be supplied with the first Number of my new book<note><hi rend="italic">Little Dorrit</hi> was published as published as vols. 350, 360, 380 and 390 of the Tauchnitz "Collection of British Authors", 1856-7. Tauchnitz also published the novel in monthly parts, with circulation limited to the European Continent.</note> in due time, and I will take care that the notice of the reservation of the translation right, appears on the cover.<note>The phrase "The author reserves the right of Translation" appears on the wrapper of the monthly parts of Little Dorrit, published by Bradbury &amp; Evans from Dec 1855 to June 1857.</note></p>
<p>My family beg to be kindly remembered. Charley<note>Charles Culliford Boz Dickens ("Charley", 1837-96), CD's eldest son, who was sent to Germany 1853-4 to learn the language.</note> particularly wishes that I should present his regards to you. He is now in the House of Baring and Co. the great merchants, and is doing very well indeed.<note>Charley had begun working for financial house of Baring Brothers, 8 Bishopsgate Street Within; see <hi rend="italic">To</hi> W.C. Macready, 4 Oct 1855, in Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 7, p. 715.</note></p>
