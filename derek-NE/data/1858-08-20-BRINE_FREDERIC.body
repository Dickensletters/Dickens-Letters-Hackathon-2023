Unfortunately, the fatigues of my hurried tour are so great and its work so hard,<note>CD delivered four readings in Liverpool, on 18, 19, 20 and 21 Aug; his first reading tour outside London extended from 2 Aug to 13 Nov 1858.</note> that I find all social pleasures to be incompatible with them, and am forced to forego all engagements and invitations. But I beg to assure you that I am not the less sensible of your cordial remembrance, and that I heartily thank you for it.
