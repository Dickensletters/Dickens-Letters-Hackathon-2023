I am more sorry than I can tell you, that I did not receive your invitation within a more convenient distance than Brighton<note>CD had been in Brighton, 31 Oct-7 Nov, after finishing <hi rend="italic">Pickwick.</hi></note> – especially as I am truly anxious to see more of you, and not to perpetuate our present angel interviews.<note>CD plays on “angel visits”, which are “few and far between”; proverbial at least by the eighteenth century: <hi rend="italic">Oxford English Dictionary</hi> cites Robert Blair, The Grave (1743), and Thomas Campbell, <hi rend="italic">The Pleasures of Hope</hi> (1797).</note> Can you take a family dinner with me, next Sunday at four? Forster dines with us, and a man named Thackeray<note>William Makepeace Thackeray (1811-63; <hi rend="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</hi>). First met CD in Apr 36, when he hoped to succeed Seymour as illustrator of Pickwick: see Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 1, p. 305n. Rejected, but contributed to <hi rend="italic">Bentley’s Miscellany</hi> (see Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 1, pp. 293n, 305 &amp; n).</note> whom perhaps you know; no one else. It will afford me very great pleasure to hear from you that we may hope to see you.
