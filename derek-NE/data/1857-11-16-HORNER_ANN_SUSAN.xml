            <salute>Dear Miss Horner </salute>
         </opener>
         <p>My having been away, has a little delayed my answer to your esteemed note; but I hope this will not seriously inconvenience you. </p>
<p>The circumstance of this article being a translated pamphlet<note>Probably one of her many Italian sources for the added chapter (see her 2nd vol., p. 473n), but not traced.</note>, already known in its general purport to the English public, is conclusive against its acceptance for Household Words. If the paper had taken an account of the pamphlet – a dissertation about it, and general description of it – the case might have been different. As it is, I must decline it: very much against my will. </p>
<p>Pray accept my sincere thanks for your offer, and believe me </p>
<p>Miss Horner.
