The moment I received the excellent Legend,<note>“Rabbi Ben Ephraim’s Treasure”, <hi rend="italic">All the Year Round</hi>, 19 Oct 61, VI, 80-84. Lytton based it, with permission, on a story told him by Robert Browning (<hi rend="italic">Letters from Owen Meredith ... to Robert and Elizabeth Barrett Browning</hi>, ed. Aurelia Brooks Harlan andJ. Lee Harlan, Jr, n.d. [1937], pp.183, 193.</note> I sent it off to the Printer’s, and placed it in the next No. I made up—that which will be published in the week after this next. It is longer than a piece of Poetry usually is in this limited space of ours;<note>Lytton’s poem occupies 7 cols; of the other 13 poems in AYR, Vol.VI, none exceeds 3 cols.</note> but I cannot call, or think, any thing so very good too long. I made one slight alteration which I hope you will excuse. For “child of my bowels”, I substituted “child of my bosom.” Your word I very well know to be more in keeping with the speaker, but I think mine the better for the public.<note>The phrase is used thrice by the Jew Zillah, addressing her daughter Rachel, with the Old Testament resonance of “bowels” as the seat of pity or compassion (compare Genesis, 43:30). CD substituted for its more physical associations, both in common usage and in the Bible (e.g. Acts, 1:18), the Biblical and common association of “bosom” with the heart and love. Lytton kept CD’s changes when republishing the poem in <hi rend="italic">Chronicles and Characters</hi>, 2 vols, 1868 (II, 85).</note> You put me to pain and shame when you write about subscribing to All The Year Round. As if it were not yours of right! I will speak to Mr. Wills<note>William Henry Wills (1810-80; <hi rend="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</hi>), assistant editor and part-proprietor of <hi rend="italic">Household Words</hi> and <hi rend="italic">All the Year Round</hi>. Wills had returned (shortly after 23 September) from a holiday on the Continent: the illness (below), not referred to elsewhere, was clearly minor and Wills was working normally on 25 October.</note> (who is now at home unwell) as to the best means of having it forwarded to you, and you may be sure of the means being punctually taken. Also, he will remit to you next week, the amount in which the Journal is indebted to you.<note>One guinea a page was the standard rate, “but it is sometimes more” (To Felton, 10 Nov 59, Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 9, p. 155). Lytton’s poem occupies 31⁄2 pages.</note> I shall be heartily glad to have more contributions when you have more to send. So much for business. I received Tannhaüser<note>Thus in MS. <hi rend="italic">Tannhäuser</hi>, or, <hi rend="italic">The Battle of the Bards</hi>. A Poem, by Neville Temple and Edward Trevor, 1861. The authors’ names were the pseudonyms of Lytton (“Edward Trevor”) and Julian Fane (1827-70; <hi rend="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</hi>), diplomat and poet, secretary of the British Legation and Embassy at Vienna, 1858-65. Fane was an admirer of the music of Wagner, whom he met in Vienna and the poem, written in alternate sections by Fane and Lytton, closely follows Wagner’s opera (Robert Lytton, <hi rend="italic">Julian Fane</hi>. A Memoir, 1871, pp.170, 173). It is in blank verse in deliberate imitation of Tennyson’s idylls, with inset songs for the Wartburg contest. Lytton had hoped the authorship of what he regarded as a light-weight work, imitative and largely written by Fane and himself for their own entertainment, would be concealed, but Fane’s pseudonym, a version of the family motto, was soon recognized and Lytton’s identity by association.</note> without hint of authorship, and immediately detected you.<note>Fane wrote the first stint: for the division of writing between him and Lytton, see <hi rend="italic">Julian Fane</hi>, pp.176ff. A review in <hi rend="italic">The Times</hi>, 2 Aug 61, “all flaming eulogy”, helped to see off one edition in two days, and by 24 September “all but” two editions of 1000 copies each (<hi rend="italic">Letters from Owen Meredith</hi>…, ed. Harlan and Harlan, pp.190-91).</note> It afforded me the greatest pleasure; and I told Chapman and Hall immediately, that it was a very remarkable poem and certain to win attention and admiration. This I mention here, not as any proof of sagacity, but as an assurance that I was honestly and strongly impressed.
