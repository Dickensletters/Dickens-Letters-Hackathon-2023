CD first saw him perform in 1856, and thought him one of the finest actors of his generation (see Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 9, p. 405). The pair were close friends in the 1860s. Fechter left Britain for the United States in December 1869.</note> 28 JUNE 1869</title>

         <p>I was not here when your note arrived. Georgina sent it after me to the office (where I was not), and it came back here, only to-day.</p>
<p>I do not see any objection to your sending that Telegram to Booth.<note>Edwin Thomas Booth (1833-93); American actor, famous for his portrayals of Shakespeare’s Hamlet, and brother of John Wilkes Booth, who assassinated President Abraham Lincoln in 1865. In February 1869 he opened Booth’s Theatre in New York City. Fechter was no doubt negotiating with Booth concerning his upcoming visit to the United States.</note>
