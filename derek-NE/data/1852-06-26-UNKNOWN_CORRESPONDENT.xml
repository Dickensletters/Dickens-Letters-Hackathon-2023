         <p>I am much obliged to you for your note – and also for the Legend.<note> Unidentified </note> You may suppose that I was rather amazed to see it again, in association with you!! It is no disparagement to it to have rejected it. I thought it at the time very good of its kind, but it was not the Household Words kind.</p>
