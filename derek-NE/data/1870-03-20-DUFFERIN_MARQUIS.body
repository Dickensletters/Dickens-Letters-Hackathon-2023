Our bright little Mrs. Finlay<note>Janet Finlay, daughter of Alexander Russel (1814-76), editor of the Scotsman newspaper in Edinburgh, where her husband Francis Dalziel Finlay (see below) had done his training. On the occasion of Finlay’s engagement, CD wrote to him about his anticipated meeting of the fiancée: ‘I hope you will make as good a report of me as you can, beforehand. For it is but fair that she should be prepared to like me, when I am in such an admirable state of preparation to like her’ (Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 10, p. 436; dated 10 October 1864).</note> is coming to dine here (with her husband)<note>Francis Dalziel Finlay (1832-1917), proprietor and editor, from 1857-74, of the Northern Whig. He was instrumental in promoting CD’s public readings in Belfast in 1858, 1867, and 1869. He also arranged for CD the purchase of an Irish jaunting car, which was used to ferry guests from Gad’s Hill to Higham station; see Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 8, p. 645. Finlay’s obituary in <hi rend="italic">The Times</hi> stated that once he took charge of the <hi rend="italic">Northern Whig</hi> he ‘introduced ideas and methods till then unknown in Irish journalism’, including a so-called ‘London Letter’, initially written by the journalist Edmund Yates (1831-94), who was a regular contributor to <hi rend="italic"></hi>All the Year Round.</note> next Wednesday at 7. We have no party, as we heard but now of their intention. I fear so short and informal a notice is not likely to find you disengaged; but if you could come, it would afford my daughter<note>Mamie Dickens.</note> and myself much pleasure, and would make Belfast joyful.
