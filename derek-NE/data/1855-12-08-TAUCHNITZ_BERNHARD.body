I beg to acknowledge the safe receipt of your two bills amounting together to £60 sterling,<note>CD’s bank account with Coutts &amp; Co. shows a deposit of £8.19s.3d on 29 December 1855, as "Bill on Heine &amp; Co. less stamp" (the exchange bank Heine, Semon &amp; Co., London, made a 9d stamping charge), and another of £50.19s.10d on 12 January 1856, shown as "Bill on James House less stamp" (the bank made a 2d stamping charge).  If the stamps cost 9d and 2d respectively, then the gross values of the bills were £9 and £51, thus totalling £60.</note> and to return you the printed form of Agreement duly signed.<note>Probably CD's payment for Little Dorrit, and possibly including the German translation fee mentioned in To Tauchnitz, 5 Nov 1855.</note>
