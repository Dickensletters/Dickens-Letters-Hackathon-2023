By the “three copies in Morocco”,<note>Presumably of <hi rend="italic">David Copperfield</hi> (published by Bradbury &amp; Evans), which completed its run in monthly parts in Nov 1850.</note> I meant (and ought to have explained that I meant) three of our usual copies that are not in cloth. – Not specially bound for me, but such as are commonly bound. Fifteen copies in all.
