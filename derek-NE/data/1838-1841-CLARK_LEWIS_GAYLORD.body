I read the Knickerbocker with very great pleasure: it is indeed a most various and entertaining periodical. It will afford me pleasure to contribute to the pages of a work which numbers among its regular correspondents such writers as Washington Irving.<note>Washington Irving (1783-1859; <hi rend="italic">Dictionary of American Biography</hi>), American author; member of the American Legation in Spain (1826) and London (1829); Minister in Spain, 1842. His works include a comic history of New York, “by Diedrich Knickerbocker” (1809), a pen name he frequently used and taken as title of the magazine, to which he was a frequent contributor; <hi rend="italic">The Sketchbook of Geoffrey Crayon</hi>, Gent (1820), which includes “Rip Van Winkle” and “The Legend of Sleepy Hollow”; and Legends of the Alhambra (1832). Greatly admired by CD: see <hi rend="italic">To</hi> Irving, 21 Apr 41 (Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 2, pp. 267-9).</note>
