I have received your book<note>The History of the Corps of Royal Sappers and Miners, 2 vols, 1855.</note> with very great pleasure. The fact of your being its author is most honorable to yourself, and scarcely less so to the service to which you belong. I feel, as your fellow countryman, a personal pride in such a work. Without retaining it longer than one evening, I have sent it (for the present), to a gentleman associated with Household Words; and I have told him he will gratify me<note>Word added above caret.</note> very much if he will go a little out of his way to write an early account of it.<note>Henry Morley’s lead article, “Mechanics in Uniform”, <hi rend="italic">Household Words</hi> 2 June 55, XI, 409, gave an enthusiastic account of Connolly’s book and its subject.</note> I need not say that I leave his judgment perfectly free; but I have sent him at the same time your letter and its enclosure,<note>Presumably letter or enclosure included reference to Sir John Fox Burgoyne (1782-1872; <hi rend="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</hi>), of the Royal Engineers (in the Crimea, 1853-5; Field-Marshal, 1868), and his recommendation of Connolly’s book for study by Royal Engineers officers (<hi rend="italic">Household Words</hi>, XI, 410)</note> and I am sure he will feel as cordial an interest in the Volumes7 as I do myself.
