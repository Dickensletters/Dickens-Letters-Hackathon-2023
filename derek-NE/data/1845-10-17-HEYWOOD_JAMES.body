I am exceedingly obliged to you for your kind invitation. It would be a great pleasure to me to accept it; but my movements are so exceedingly uncertain, my arrival in Manchester<note>CD had agreed to attend the Manchester Athenaeum’s soirée on 23 Oct, to support Talfourd, the evening’s President. Heywood evidently asked CD to do something else than just attend: see also <hi rend="italic">To</hi> Leech, 17 Oct, and, for the soirée, Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 4, p. 413<hi rend="italic">nn</hi>.</note> so dependant on circumstances, and the period of my stay so very short, that I deem it best to hold myself aloof from all engagements there. I have many occupations at this moment of a very pressing nature; and Mrs Dickens being unwell besides, and very near her confinement,<note>Catherine gave birth to Alfred D’Orsay Tennyson Dickens on 28 Oct. CD had already made clear her pregnancy meant his visit to Manchester must be brief: five days later, he withdrew altogether (<hi rend="italic">To</hi> Berlyn, 22 Oct).</note> I am really afraid to make engagements.
