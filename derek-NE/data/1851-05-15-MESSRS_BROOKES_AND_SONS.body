I beg to send you the book,<note><hi rend="italic">David Copperfield</hi>. Messrs Brookes had written to CD about the appearance of their name (“Brookes of Sheffield”) in Ch. 2 of <hi rend="italic">Copperfield</hi>. They sent CD a case of cutlery and CD in return offered his own copy of <hi rend="italic">Copperfield</hi> (see <hi rend="italic">To</hi> Messrs Brookes and Sons, 25 Apr 51; Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 6, p. 362).</note> which I find has been delayed by a mistake. Pray receive it with every assurance of my good will and esteem.
