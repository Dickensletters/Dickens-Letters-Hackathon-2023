The Amateur Company, organized by CD on his return from Italy, had acted Ben Jonson’s <hi rend="italic">Every Man in His Humour</hi> there, 20 Sep 45: see Forster, V, i, 380-1 and Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 4.</note> are going to act twice at Covent Garden for the benefit of Mr. Leigh Hunt<note>James Henry Leigh Hunt (1784-1859; <hi rend="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</hi>), essayist, critic and poet: see Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 1, p. 341n. CD was planning a benefit performance by the Amateurs for Hunt, whose financial affairs were (as only too often) critical: see further Pilgrim Letters 5, p. 77 n.3.</note> whose distinguished literary name and services are, no doubt, known to you.
