I have given your letter my best consideration and I hope that you will believe that it would be a pleasure to me to accept the request it prefers, if my existing arrangements here reasonably admitted of my doing so. But they do not. Without entering into details that would make the fact as plain to you as it is to myself, I beg you to receive the assurance from me. aAt all times, I should be most ready and willing to make money matters easy to your convenience – to discuss with you on any subjects that may arise in your mind – to make your work as certain, as useful, that may arise in your mind – to make your work as certain, as useful, and as agreeable to you as it can be made. I hope my desire to render our connexion both profitable and pleasant to you in all ways will, – for thetime at all events, – so express itself as to serve in place of your proposed arrangement.<note>i.e. a formal contract; Hollingshead wrote more than 30 articles for <hi rend="italic">All the Year Round</hi> 1859-61.</note>a
