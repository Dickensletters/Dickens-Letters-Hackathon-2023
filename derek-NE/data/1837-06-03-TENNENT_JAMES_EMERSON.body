I fear that by this time you will have set <hi rend="italic">me</hi> down as the rudest of <hi rend="italic">your</hi> chance acquaintances. If so, let me make my apology in one word. On the night on which I was to have dined with you at Richmond, a very dear young relative was taken ill in my house, and after a few hours’ suffering died.<note>CD’s sister-in-law, Mary Hogarth, died suddenly on 7 May 1837.</note> It has been a heavier blow to me than I could describe were I disposed; and for a few weeks it has completely overwhelmed me.<note>See, for example, letter to William Harrison Ainsworth: ‘I have been so much unnerved and hurt by the loss of the dear girl whom I loved, after my wife, more deeply and fervently than anyone on earth, that I have been compelled for once to give up all idea of my monthly work, and to try a fortnight's rest and quiet. We have hired a very small cottage here, and have repaired hither for a little change of air and scene’ (Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 6, p. 260; dated 17 May 1837).</note>
