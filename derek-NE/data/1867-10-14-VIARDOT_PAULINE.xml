         <p>I send you, out of my heart, my most earnest thanks for your affectionate note and kind wishes. I would that I could always have you among my American audiences, for there is no genius in this world more sympathetic and responsive than yours,<note>Viardot had presumably sent CD best wishes for his American tour (he sailed in November). It was Viardot’s responsive power above all that marked her out: Berlioz decribed her in Gluck’s <hi rend="italic">Orfeo</hi> (a role she performed over 130 times, 1859- 63) as fusing “an indomitable verve, thrilling and commanding, with a deep sensibility and an almost shattering ability to express great sorrow” (<hi rend="italic">The Art of Music</hi> [A Travers Chants], trans. Elizabeth Csicsery-Rónay, Bloomington &amp; Indianapolis, 1994, p.77).</note> or that I could have a greater pride and interest in addressing! Your photograph is one of the best I ever saw, and is already stationed in a post of honour in this house. I send my kind regards to M. Viardot,<note>Louis Viardot (1800-83), journalist and miscellaneous writer; director of the Théâtre Italien, 1838-40; radical in politics: see Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 7, p. 763n.</note> and am ever</p>
