Many thanks for the curious and interesting MS.<note>Unidentified; possibly by Poole, though CD reported in 1850 that Poole, in “a prematurely shattered state”, was “perfectly unable to write” (To Lord John Russell, 18 Dec 50, Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 6, p. 239). CD’s description of Poole to Collins in October 1862 does not suggest any return of literary powers (Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 10, p. 138).</note>
