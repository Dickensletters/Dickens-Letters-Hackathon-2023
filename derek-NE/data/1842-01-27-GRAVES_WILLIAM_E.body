I am much indebted to you for your polite and obliging letter. I have arranged to visit the different institutions of the City, in company with your respected Mayor,<note>Jonathan Chapman (1807-48), politician and eighth Mayor of Boston 1840-2. CD found in him a kindred spirit, and formed an "alliance" with him; see <hi rend="italic">To</hi> Chapman, 22 Feb 1842, in Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 3, pp. 76-7. In the same letter CD declares himself "sick to death of the life I have been leading here – worn out in mind and body".</note> on Wednesday next.<note>On Wednesday 2 February 1842 CD breakfasted with the Rev. W.E. Channing, and met J. G. Maeder – one of the Boston musicians who composed "Boz Waltzes" in his honour. He was expected for dinner at the residence of J. W. Paige, but did not attend owing to fatigue. For CD's other activities in Boston that week see Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 3, p. 48, n.1.</note> I hope I shall then have an opportunity of thanking you in person<note>Thus in MS (no full stop).</note>
