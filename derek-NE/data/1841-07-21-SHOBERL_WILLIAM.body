I beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter in answer to mine of this morning;<note>Ambiguous; CD means “your letter received this morning” (see Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi>  2, pp. 333, n.4, and 334 &amp; n).</note> which is quite satisfactory. I need not, I am sure, point out the necessity of being very particular in respect of the form of advertisement in the weekly papers. As there has been ample time for correction, I am sure you will have attended to it.<note>Clearly referring to problems over the publication of <hi rend="italic">The Pic Nic Papers</hi>: see Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 2, p. 334n.
