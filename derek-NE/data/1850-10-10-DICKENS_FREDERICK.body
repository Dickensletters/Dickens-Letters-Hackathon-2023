You must not suppose that the item you extract from my sum of objection, though a great one, is the total.<note>Fred had proposed that CD stand security for a loan to cover debts of about £600 (Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 6, pp. 180n, 198). CD refused to be security, stressing particularly (presumably the “item” Fred referred to) his unease at the thought “of bequeathing such an obligation” to any of his (CD’s) children who might outlive him (<hi rend="italic">To</hi> Fred, 26 Sep, Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 6, p. 180).</note> Many other objections of the strongest kind to the recurrence of such a responsibility would remain, if that were disposed of. [ ]<note> Illegible word deleted.
