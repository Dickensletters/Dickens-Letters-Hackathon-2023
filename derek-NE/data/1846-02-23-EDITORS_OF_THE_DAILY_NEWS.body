 I choose this time for addressing to you, the first of two or three letters on the subject of Capital Punishment, because it seems to me that the importance of the question is very strongly presented to the public mind just now, by a recent execution in Ireland:<note>Bryan (or Brian) Seery, who was hanged at Mullingar, Co. Westmeath, 13 Feb 1846 for the attempted murder of his landlord, Sir Francis Hopkins. “He had been found guilty of discharging a loaded gun at Sir Francis Hopkins on November 18, 1845, but was widely believed to be innocent” (Tillotson, p. 704). <hi rend="italic">The Daily News</hi> published “reports of the petition to the Lord Lieutenant and of opinion in the district, with sympathetic comment from their Irish correspondent, who was at that time R. H. Horne” (p. 704). The first jury was unable to agree; but at the second trial, Seery was found guilty of attempted murder (Paroissien p. 216).</note> and the recent acquittal, in England, of one of the most cruel murderers of whom we have any record.<note>Both Tillotson and Paroissien suggest this refers to Captain George Johnstone of the Tory, who was arrested in Nov 1845 and charged with committing atrocities against his crew, and the grisly murder of three crew members (Rambert, Reason and Mars). The trial took place from 5-6 Feb 1846; Johnstone was initially found guilty of murder, before the jury reconsidered, finding him not guilty on the ground of insanity (Paroissien p. 217).</note> And although there can be no doubt that such a theme, of all others, should be considered with the calmest reference to its own broad Right and Wrong, and not with a limited appeal to its illustration in this or that instance; still, I apprehend that cases like these resolve themselves so directly into the general question, as to have a legitimate and very powerful bearing on it; and that no better occasion can be seized for reviving its discussion, than when such circumstances are generally remembered.
