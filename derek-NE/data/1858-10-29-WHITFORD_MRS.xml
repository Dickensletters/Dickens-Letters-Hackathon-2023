            <salute>My Dear Mrs. Whitford</salute>
         </opener>
         <p>I received your letter at Leeds<note>CD read at Leeds, 28 Oct, on his Autumn reading tour.</note> this morning, and I read it with much interest, and I hasten (in a moment’s interval of rest), to reply to it.</p>
<p>It would have given me great pleasure to have come to see you, if such a thing had been reasonably possible. But the fatigues and occupations of the tour now drawing to a close, are so great, that from its commencement in the beginning of August down to this time I have set foot in no friend’s house and have eaten or drunk at no friend’s table. The “very grand folks” and the very plain folks everywhere have been equally shut out from me. I have hurried for a few hours at a time to London or to my little country house in Kent whenever I have had a short space of repose; but I have known all other diversion from the 18one thing I have had to do, to be quite incompatible with it.</p>
<p>My mother,<note>Elizabeth Dickens (1789-1863); she had had “a strong objection to being considered in the least old” (10 Feb 55; Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 7, p. 534 &amp; n), but would shortly decline into senility.</note> who is alive and well though not unshaken by Time, will will<note>Written twice by CD</note> be greatly interested when I tell her of your having written to me. Letitia and her husband,<note>This suggests a particular friendship with Letitia (who married Henry Austin in 1837). For possible identification of Mrs Whitford with a Miss Urquhart, see Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 8, p. 692, n.4. and Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 1, p. 31 &amp; nn.</note> I often see. They have no children, and are doing very well.</p>
<p>I beg to send my regard to your liege Lord, and to that most wonderful of all the prodigies I have ever heard of—the only child—who is not a prodigy</p>
<p>Mrs. Whitford.</p>
