 I have thoroughly made up my mind that I will never become a candidate for a seat in the House of Commons,<note>Throughout the 1850s and 1860s, CD repeated his determination never to enter the Commons: see e.g. To De La Prynne, 14 Mar 57, Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 8, p. 300; <hi rend="italic">To</hi> T. A. Trollope, 13 Sep 68, Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 12, p. 182; and <hi rend="italic">To</hi> Freeman, 19 Apr 69, Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 12, p. 337.</note> and that I will not depart from my old sphere of action.
