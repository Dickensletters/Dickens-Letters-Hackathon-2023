            <title>CHARLES DICKENS JNR, [? MID JUNE 1851- MID JUNE 1852]<note>Charles Culliford Boz Dickens (1837-96; <hi rend="italic">DIctionary of National Biography</hi>); Charley (CD's eldest son) was at Eton, Jan 50-Dec 52. On present evidence, CD visited him there five times. Presumably CD went alone, late May 51and early-mid Nov 51 (Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 6, pp. 407, 542); he went with friends on 1 July 51 (Beard), 24 Feb 52 (Leech), 1 July 52 (Beard and Lemon): Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 6, pp. 416, 606, 699. The agreed train times for these latter three do not fit the details here, though arrangements may have been finalised differently. On current information, probably arranging for one of these three latter outings.</note></title>

         <p>I think there is a Great Western morning train which arrives at Slough at 3 minutes past 10.We will come down by that. Or we could arrive at Windsor by the same train, at 11.<note>By changing at Slough to the Windsor branch line.</note> Wouldn’t that be best? </p>
