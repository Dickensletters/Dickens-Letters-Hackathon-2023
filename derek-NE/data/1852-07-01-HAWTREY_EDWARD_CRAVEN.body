 I am most singularly unfortunate with you. On Saturday, I have a semi-public engagement which is associated with a very important design;<note>On Saturday 3 July CD had dinner with the architect Coutts Stone (1819-1902); see <hi rend="italic">To</hi> Angela Burdett Coutts, 30 June 1852, in Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 6, p. 702. Stone was working with CD's brother-in-law Henry Austin on the plans for Miss Coutts's project for improved sanitation in 150 tenement houses in Westminster; see To Angela Burdett Coutts, 3 Dec 1852, in Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 6, pp. 812-14.</note>  and for Tuesday, I have been engaged this fortnight!<note>CD was in Folkestone on Tuesday 6 July.</note> Nevertheless, I shall still hope that when the Fates have had enough of keeping us asunder, we shall meet.
