Of course the wording of the Minute<note>Clearly touching on and delaying Fred’s promotion: see <hi rend="italic">To</hi> Fred, 12 Sep, Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 2, p. 379.</note> is of some importance, but I don’t think that its having been made, is the discouraging and ominous circumstance you take it for. It seems to me natural enough that Archer<note>Thomas Archer (?1782-1855), civil servant; Principal Clerk in the Commissariat Dept of the Treasury: see Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 2, p. 379n.</note> being away, and the Ministers going out,<note>The Whigs under Lord Melbourne were defeated, 27 August; Sir Robert Peel became Prime Minister, 30 Aug.</note> the step should not be taken until his return; and the more your promotion was a mere matter of course, the more likely (in my eyes) that it should be left, with other business, to the New Lords.<note>I.e. the Lords of the Treasury in the new government. Fred was promoted to Senior Clerk, second class: see <hi rend="italic">To</hi> Fred Dickens, 26 Sep, and <hi rend="italic">To</hi> John Forster, [26 Sep], Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 2, pp. 392, 393.</note> I suppose you will soon see whether my impression is right or wrong. I shall be anxious to know, and beg you will let me hear without loss of time. Mitton<note>Thomas Mitton (1812-78), solicitor, one of CD’s earliest close friends; CD’s solicitor from 1838: see Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 1, p. 35<hi rend="italic">n</hi>.</note> is here, but he goes to town again on Saturday morning – preparatory to his Great Northern Tour.<note>On 22 Sep, when Mitton was back in London, CD refers to his having been “cruising about” for a week or two: <hi rend="italic">To</hi> Mitton, 22 Sep, Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 2, pp. 389-90.</note>
