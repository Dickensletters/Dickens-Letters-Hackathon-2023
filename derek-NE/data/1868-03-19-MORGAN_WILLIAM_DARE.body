I most heartily congratulate you on your happiness. None of your old and true friends can be more deeply interested in it than your undersigned correspondent and all the household at Gad’s Hill. I look forward to being presented to Miss Hoyt,<note>Angelica Livingston Hoyt (1847-1933), Morgan’s fiancée</note> and to welcoming her, beforehand, to my Household Gods and Goddesses: – you know how warmly.
