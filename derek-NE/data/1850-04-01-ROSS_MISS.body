I am very sorry that I cannot be of any assistance to you in the matter you confide to me. Nor need I hesitate, in the same confidence, to tell you why. It is not a month, since I communicated with Lord John Russell<note>Lord John Russell (1792-1878; <hi rend="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</hi>), Prime minister 1846-52, author and friend of CD.</note> on the subject of a small pension for Mr Poole<note>John Poole (1785/6-1872; <hi rend="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</hi>), playwright, author of the highly successful Paul Pry (1825) and very popular in the days of CD’s youth. In the mid-1840s he fell on hard times and relied on the kindness of CD, John Forster and Thomas Noon Talfourd. They negotiated grants to him from the Royal Literary Fund, and in 1847 CD donated to him some of the proceeds of his amateur theatrical performances at Liverpool and Manchester. See letters from CD to Russell on Poole’s behalf, Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 6 pp. 232-3 and pp. 239-40. Poole was awarded a Civil List pension of £100 p.a.</note>, who has no means of existence and is quite unable to write. The question is still pending, but Lord John immediately assisted him from another public source, and that in so handsome a manner that I should feel it (as I am sure you will understand<note>A small tear has removed the final "d".</note> on this explanation) indelicate and obtrusive, to bring another such application under his notice.
