The statement is unimportant to me, but as it might cast a slur on the conduct of a most excellent officer in the discharge of his duty, I beg you to do him the justice of contradicting it, on my assurance that it is one of the most extravagant inventions I have ever seen in my life, without a scrap of truth for its foundation.<note>See William F. Long, ‘Inspector Field and the Improbable Gift’, <hi rend="italic">Dickens Quarterly</hi> 30.1 (2013): 43-54. Long suggests it may have been Field himself who circulated the rumour: Field set himself up as a private detective in 1853, writing to Dickens in August to ask for help in promoting his new business (Long 48; 27 Aug 1853, Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 12, p. 652). However, as Long notes, the article incorrectly gives Field the title of ‘Sergeant’, and risked doing more harm to Field’s reputation than good.</note>
