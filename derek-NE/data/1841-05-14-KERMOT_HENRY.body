  I regret I assure you, – and I beg you to inform the Committee of Management that I do so, quite sincerely – the not being able, at this time, to subscribe towards the Funds of the Saint Martin's Library.<note> St Martin's Library, in Castle Street, Leicester Square. This public library, the first in London, was established in 1684 by Thomas Tenison (1635-1715), then Vicar of St Martin-in-the-Fields and later Archbishop of Canterbury. By the 1840s the library was funded by subscriptions, and had run into financial difficulties; it eventually closed in 1861.
