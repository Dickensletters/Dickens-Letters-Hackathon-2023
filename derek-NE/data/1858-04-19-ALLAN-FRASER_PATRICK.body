 I have not a doubt that such a provision as you describe in your letter from Hawkesbury Hall would carry out, in an admirable manner, the principles and objects of the Guild.<note>Fraser and his wife Elizabeth offered to donate Hawkesbury Hall in Warwickshire, which Elizabeth had inherited from her mother, to the Guild of Literature and Art, founded with CD’s assistance in 1851. See Michael Slater, "Munificence Declined: New Letters about the Guild of Literature and Art", <hi rend="italic">Dickensian</hi> 111.1 (2015): 34-41. See also CD’s letters to Fraser of 3 May 1858, 12 May 1858, and 22 May 1858.</note>
