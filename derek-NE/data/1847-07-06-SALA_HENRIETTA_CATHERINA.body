Your letter has been forwarded to me here,<note>CD was at Broadstairs 26 June to 29 Sept, visiting London as necessary on business.</note> and I hasten to reply to it. I fear a letter of introduction to Messrs. Bradbury and Evans would be of no service to you, as they scarcely publish at all except for myself,<note>CD had transferred from Chapman &amp; Hall as his publishers to Bradbury &amp; Evans in 1844: see PIlgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 4 and Robert L. Patten, <hi rend="italic">CD and His Publishers</hi>, 1978, ch. 8. Bradbury &amp; Evans were mainly printers and largely without the business experience to be publishers: see CD’s similar statements to G. H. Lewes (17 Feb 48; Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 5, p. 248) and to Lady Blessington (4 Apr 48; Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 5, pp. 271-2).</note> unless it be for the Writers in periodicals of their own proprietorship.<note>Bradbury &amp; Evans were publishers of <hi rend="italic">Punch</hi> from 1841 and of the Daily News from 1846. For details of <hi rend="italic">Punch</hi> contributors they published and of other publications, see Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 5, p. 248, n.3.</note> Nor do I like to give you the pain, or them the trouble, of a fruitless interview; although I assure you, if I had the least reason – the very scantiest – to believe (having the means of judging) that it could lead to any useful result, I would most gladly comply with your request. As I can have no desire in such a matter but to point out to you the plain truth, and help you if I can, let me propose that this should stand over for ten or twelve days, until I can give you an interview. I purpose being in town on Sunday the Eighteenth, and will immediately write to you, proposing an appointment.<note>Not traced, if it took place, nor Mme Sala’s publishing proposal. CD came to London to rehearse the Amateurs (above) for the Manchester and Liverpool performances (<hi rend="italic">To</hi> Willmott, 6 July 47; Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 5, p. 119).</note> As your eyes are bad, do not take the trouble to reply to this, unless you have any objection to urge. If I do not hear from you, I will take care to be mindful of my pledge.
