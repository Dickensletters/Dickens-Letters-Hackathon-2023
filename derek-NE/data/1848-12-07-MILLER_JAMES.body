 Pray allow me to thank you for your very interesting pamphlet on chloroform,<note><hi rend="italic">Surgical Experience of Chloroform</hi> (Edinburgh: Sutherland and Knox, 1848).</note> which I have read with great interest and satisfaction. I feel sure it will do good service, and go far to eradicate those monstrous absurdities on the subject, which linger (I am ashamed to confess) in some parts of these Southern Regions.<note>Chloroform had been first used as an anaesthetic in childbirth by Miller's colleague James Young Simpson on 8 Nov 1847 (see <hi rend="italic">To</hi> Alfred Dickens, 1 Jan 48, fn, in Pilgrim Letters 5, p. 221); Simpson's published account a week later attracted immense publicity. It was soon in regular use in Edinburgh for both childbirth and surgery, but met with considerable opposition in London. Medical arguments against chloroform included the claim that mother or child would be impaired mentally, that natural labour would be impeded, and that the drug would "excite improper sexual feelings and expressions in women" (G. T. Gream, quoted in John A. Shepherd, <hi rend="italic">Simpson and Syme of Edinburgh</hi> [London: E &amp; S Livingstone 1969], p. 98). Some deaths during operations aroused great concern. Despite the regular use of chloroform in Edinburgh, France and America, <hi rend="italic">The Times</hi> (12 Mar 1850) deplored the continued professional prejudice against it in London. In Apr 1853 Queen Victoria used it for the birth of Prince Leopold. At his death CD owned five pamphlets by Simpson on anaesthetics and related subjects (<hi rend="italic">Catalogue of the Library of Charles Dickens</hi>, ed. J. H. Stonehouse [London: Piccadilly Fountain Press, 1935], p. 88).</note>
