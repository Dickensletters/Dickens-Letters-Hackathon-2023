         </opener>
         <p>We have entered into an arrangement with the Shakespeare House committee,<note>On 7 Dec 47, the London Shakespeare Committee, following the purchase of Shakespeare’s birthplace in Sep, had announced its wish to place it “under the superintendence of some Person honourably connected with Dramatic Literature” (Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 5, p. 222 <hi rend="italic">n</hi>.2). By Apr 48, CD had proposed the endowment of a curatorship through performances by the Amateur Company (ibid.).</note> to play twice in London,<note>At the Theatre Royal, Haymarket, 15 and 17 May.
</note> for the purpose of founding a fund to endow a Curator of the house, who shall always be someone associated with English literature.<note>CD intended the first beneficiary to be James Sheridan Knowles (1784-1862; <hi rend="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</hi>), the dramatist and actor, whose plays included <hi rend="italic">Virginius</hi> (1820) and <hi rend="italic">The Hunchback</hi> (1832). CD had been concerned to learn of Knowles's bankruptcy in Nov 47; in the event, less than £600 of the proposed £1,000 was raised and Knowles received it as a lump sum (Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 5, pp. 222 n.1, 423 n.3).</note> The design being, to connect with the place and the name, an honourable retreat for one distinguished man through all time. The exact time of acting is not yet fixed, but I have proposed some time between the middle and end of May. The Merry Wives on the first night; Every man in his Humour on the second. An interval, probably of a week, between the two performances. I hope we may count on your kind assistance.<note>Fortescue played Mistress Ford in Shakespeare and repeated her role of Mistress Kitely in Jonson (she had performed it in 1845). Fortescue did not appear in the subsequent provincial performances.</note> Next Saturday we rehearse a farce,<note><hi rend="italic">Animal Magnetism</hi> (see below); the rehearsal took place at Fanny Kelly's private theatre, 73 Dean Street, Soho (Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 5, p. 281). The Company played James Kenney's farce, <hi rend="italic">Love, Law, and Physic</hi> (1812) after <hi rend="italic">Every Man in His Humour</hi>.</note> but on that day week we shall probably resume the Merry Wives; and if you will allow me, I will beg my brother<note>Frederick Dickens (1820-68).</note> to send you a list of our calls<note>i.e. dates for rehearsals.</note> and other arrangements, as soon as it can be made out. We are going to do Mrs Inchbald’s Animal Magnetism<note>The farce (1788) by Elizabeth Inchbald (1753-1821; Dictionary of <hi rend="italic">National Biography</hi>), actress and author</note> with the Merry Wives, and I hope we shall do it very well. </p>
