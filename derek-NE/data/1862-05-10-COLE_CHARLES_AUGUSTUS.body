I am very sorry that I cannot have the pleasure of accepting this little paper, but it really is not suitable for our purpose here. If it had come a little earlier, I would have taken it, because of its hitting the nick of time. But we are always a fortnight ahead, and it would be too late. Pray thank the authoress<note>Neither authoress nor paper identified.
