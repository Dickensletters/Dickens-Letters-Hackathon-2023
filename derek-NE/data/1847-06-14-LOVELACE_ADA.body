On Thursday next at half past Seven, I hope to break the spell.<note>CD had evidently attempted to call on Lovelace previously, and had been unsuccessful, following his letter to Lovelace on 31 Mar 1847, requesting the address of a friend living in Genoa, Sir George William Craufurd; see Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 5, p. 49, and <hi rend="italic">To</hi> Ada Lovelace [?4 or 11 April 1847].</note> Many thanks for giving me another chance of doing so!
