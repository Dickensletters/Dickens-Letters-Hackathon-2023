My Dear Marion. I hear from Georgina that she has herself replied to your letter in my absence. You may implicitly rely on what she tells you of her health.<note>Georgina had been unwell at least since June 1862, and when CD, doubting Dr John Elliotson’s diagnosis, had a consultation with Archibald Billing (see <hi rend="italic">To</hi> Wilkie Collins, 20 July 1862 &amp;amp; n, in Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 10, p. 109), her condition was diagnosed as “aneurism of the aorta”, though no danger was apprehended. Later, CD reports that “Georgy continues wonderfully well” (Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 10, p. 183; see also p. 253). On Georgina's illness see Arthur A. Adrian, <hi rend="italic">Georgina Hogarth and the Dickens Circle</hi> (London: Oxford University Press, 1957), pp. 76-8.</note> No doubt she was exceedingly ill, and occasioned us great anxiety; the rather,<note>A now rare expression, meaning "the more so" or "for this reason".</note> as at first her disorder seemed steadily to increase. But the change has been so very decided and marked, so entirely without drawback, and so surprising altogether, that I begin to believe there has been some complete spontaneous cure of what was wrong. Since we have been here, she has been perfectly well; and as to the long journey, it no more affected her than it affected Mary.\
