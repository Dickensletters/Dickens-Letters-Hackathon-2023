I am exceedingly sorry that my vote is regularly given, in aid of another deserving applicant,<note>Presumably for the Hospital for Incurables; one of Lady Westmorlandâ€™s daughters had applied to CD for his vote in 1863 (Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 10, pp. 274-5). See also <hi rend="italic">To</hi> Mrs David Lloyd, 29 Nov 65, Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 11, p. 113.</note> who seems to be perpetually seeking and never finding. In the hope that we may have the pleasure of seeing you before long, Believe me always
