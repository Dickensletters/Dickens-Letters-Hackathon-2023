         <p>In reply to your letter, I beg to say that I do not think that the point to which you call my attention is one coming within the province of a chairman at a Public Dinner.<note>CD was Chairman of the Newsvendors’ Benevolent Dinner on 9 May and of the Newspaper Press Fund Dinner on 29 May: see K. J. Fielding, <hi rend="italic">The Speeches of CD</hi>, pp. 337- 348.</note> The principle is a very sound one, but always has to be considered with a reference to the number of members a Society is likely to be composed of, and also the [*] amount of [**]<note>Three words not clear from computer image.</note> it is likely to require. For these reasons I regard it as belonging to the administration of the Body and deem that your suggestion would be more appropriately addressed to the President of the Institution than to the President of the Dinner.</p>
