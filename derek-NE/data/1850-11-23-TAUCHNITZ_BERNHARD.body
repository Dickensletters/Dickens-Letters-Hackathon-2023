I much regret not having the pleasure of seeing you this year,<note>Tauchnitz's visit to England untraced.</note> and also the unfortunate cause of your not visiting England.<note>The reason for Tauchnitz's abandonment of his visit not discovered.</note> I beg to acknowledge the safe receipt of your draft for £a35,<note>For publication of <hi rend="italic">David Copperfield</hi> in Tauchntiz’s “Collection of British Authors”; see Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 5, p. 609n. Payment was received into CD’s bank account with Coutts &amp; Co. on 29 Nov 1850, as "Bill on Fruhling &amp; Co." (the German bank Fruhling &amp; Goschen, at 12 Austin Friars, London).</note> aand to assure you that I shall not fail to give you timely notice of any new work I may undertake.a<note>As CD's authorised publisher in Germany, Tauchnitz not only received advance notice of the publication of new works by CD; he was also sent proofs of these works, so that German and British publication of CD's works could coincide.</note>
