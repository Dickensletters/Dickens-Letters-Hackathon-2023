I had not the least intention of returning you the enclosed paper,<note>Clearly Mrs Linton had asked CD to return her review of John Forster’s <hi rend="italic">Biography</hi> of Walter Savage Landor. <hi rend="italic">Fraser’s Magazine</hi>, N. S. Vol. II, July 70 published an article by her entitled “Reminiscences of Walter Savage Landor” in which she endeavoured “to redress, by my testimony, the unjust balance of public opinion by which he has been weighed only according to his demerits”; although she mentions both Forster and Dickens, nowhere does she refer to Forster’s book; no review with the opening words quoted by Layard (<hi rend="italic">To Eliza Lynn Linton</hi>, 19 June 1869, <hi rend="italic">n</hi>) yet discovered.</note> and had ordered it – in right of our long association – to be placed to your credit in the business account. That order I shall certainly not cancel (except under compulsion) but you are perfectly free to publish the paper nevertheless.
