I have received your very welcome note,<note>No doubt forwarded from the office by Wills.</note> and I beg very cordially to thank you. But unfortunately I have not received the newspaper to which your note refers. Could you have the kindness to send me a copy of the Sonnet<note>Not traced.</note> I am naturally anxious to read – either to Glasgow (care of Mr Muir Wood,<note>John Muir Wood, of J. M. Wood &amp;amp Co., pianoforte and music sellers, 42 Buchanan Street, Glasgow; CD’s agents for his readings in Glasgow.</note> Buchanan Street), between this and Saturday; or to my house (Tavistock House) in London, afterwards?
