         </opener>
         <p>A thousand thanks! I am happy to be free from reading on the 21st of this month, and be with you please God.<note>CD kept this dinner appointment with the Procters; see To Anne Procter, 18 Nov 1868, in Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 12, p. 223.</note></p>
<p>            I wish I could write as plainly as you do.<note>CD admired Procter's poems, and published several in <hi rend="italic">Household Words</hi> and <hi rend="italic">All the Year Round</hi>. He also praised his memoir of Charles Lamb (Edward Moxon, 1866) for “the force and vigour of the style” (<hi rend="italic">To</hi> B.W. Procter, Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 11 pp. 234); Thomas Carlyle similar praised its "Brevity, perspicuity, graceful clearness" (qtd. in <hi rend="italic">Bryan Waller Procter (Barry Cornwall): An Autobiographical Fragment and Biographical Notes, with Personal Sketches of Contemporaries, Unpublished Lyrics, and Letters of Literary Friends</hi>, ed. Coventry Patmore [Boston: Roberts Brothers, 1877], p. 106). Procter, who had been writing sadly of his age and increasing infirmity since the late 1850s, had suffered a stroke earlier in 1868 which left him partially paralysed and reliant on an invalid’s chair. CD’s comment may have been in response to Procter’s characteristic self-deprecation, particularly in light of the impairment to his speech caused by the stroke which had left him isolated from his friends.</note></p>
<p>  With my love to Mrs Procter<note>Anne Procter (1799-1888), daughter of Captain Thomas Skepper and Anne Dorothea (afterwards the third wife of Basil Montagu); married Bryan Waller Procter 1824; well known as the witty hostess of a wide literary circle. CD had known the couple since the late 1830s.</note></p>
