I do not remember to have received any such communication from you as you describe in your letter dated four days since. As I have left Tavistock House these two years,<note>On Tavistock Square in Bloomsbury, where CD lived from 1851 to 1860.</note> it may have gone to my office in London<note>The office of CD's journal, <hi rend="italic">All the Year Round</hi>, at 26 Wellington Street, Strand.</note> and have been set aside by some mistake in the great accumulation of correspondence there.
