         <p>Coming to town this morning for the day,<note>CD was in Folkestone, ‘hammering away’ at Little Dorrit (see To Macready, 4 Oct).</note> I find your two letters together.</p>
<p>For myself, I am bound at once to say that I am far from sanguine of the success of your enterprize,<note>Not traced.</note> and that I am not disposed to join it.</p>
<p>As to Miss Burdett Coutts, I am unable to give you any authorized reply, as that lady is in the South of France.<note>Angela Burdett CouttsAngela Georgina Burdett (1814-1906; <hi rend="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</hi>), later Baroness Burdett Coutts, youngest child of Sir Francis Burdett and Sophia, daughter of Thomas Coutts, the banker, whom CD assisted in her philanthropic projects. She was travelling with Dr William and Mrs Brown (the latter her former companion, Hannah Meredith), returning from the Pyrenees by way of Montpellier.</note> But I have a strong impression that an application to her to become a shareholder would be certainly unsuccessful, and that her interest in such a design would altogether depend upon the manner of its realization and execution.</p>
<p>I hope your experience may rapidly disprove my misgivings, and I beg to assure you that your second note needed no apology.</p>
<p>J. Palgrave Simpson Esquire. </p>
