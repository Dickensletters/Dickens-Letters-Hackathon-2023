         <p>I have read the draught of the article on the proposed treaty of Copyright with America,<note>A Treaty “for the Establishment of International Copyright” had been signed in Washington (see Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 6, p. 713n) in Feb 53; opposed by American publishers, it failed to be ratified by the Senate: see further on this and the Sixth Article, Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 7, p. 236, nn. 6 &amp; 7.</note> designed to be substituted for the Sixth article of the Convention; and I consider it decidedly advantageous to English Authors, and can have no doubt of their generally receiving it in that light. I may be supposed to have a considerable interest in the question, and I am satisfied with it myself. On principle I object to any limitation whatever on an Author’s right in his own works; but, as the law of England confiscates his property when his successors mosta bneed it,<note>By the Copyright Act, 1842, copyright ran for 42 years from the date of publication or seven years after the author’s death, whichever was longer (see Robert L. Patten, <hi rend="italic">CD and His Publishers</hi>, 1978, p. 19 &amp; n. 28).</note> I have no right to quarrel with America for requiring him to establish his title to it within three months. The provisions as to the stereotyping or printing of a book taking place in the country in which it is republished, being reciprocal, does not seem unreasonable or unfair. I have mentioned this point to my printers Messrs. Bradbury and Evans of Whitefriars, who are in a very large way of business as printers of books; and they concur with me in this opinion. With many thanks for your courtesy, I am</p>
