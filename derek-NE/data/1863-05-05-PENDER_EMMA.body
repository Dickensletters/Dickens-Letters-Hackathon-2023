Mr Charles Dickens very much regrets that as he is announced to read on Friday the Fifteenth,<note>CD read <hi rend="italic">Little Dombey</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The Trial from Pickwick</hi> in Hanover Square Rooms, London, on 15 May 1863.</note> he cannot have the honor of dining with Mr and Mrs Pender on that day.
