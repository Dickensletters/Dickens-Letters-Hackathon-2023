I beg to acknowledge the safe receipt of your draft for £100 sterling;<note>£100 was credited to CD’s bank account on 22 March 1852, and entered in the ledger of Coutts &amp;amp; Co. as "Bill on Stern Bros" (bankers, with headquarters in Frankfurt, and London offices at 57 Gracechurch Street). £50 of this was Tauchnitz's payment to CD for permission to publish <hi rend="italic">Bleak House</hi> in his “Collection of British Authors” series. The other £50 was a payment to CD for publication of <hi rend="italic">Household Words</hi> by Tauchnitz. This is one of the few instances where a £50 payment by Tauchnitz, intended for the Household Words account with Coutts &amp;amp; Co., ended up in CD's personal bank account; for other instances see <hi rend="italic">To</hi> Tauchnitz, 8 April 1856 and 7 Oct 1856.</note> namely £50 on account of Household Words,<note>In 1851-6, Tauchnitz reprinted <hi rend="italic">Household Words</hi> in 36 volumes. These were supplemented by a further 11 volumes of <hi rend="italic">Novels and Tales Reprinted from Household Words</hi> (1856-9). Tauchnitz paid CD half-yearly sums of £50 for these publications.</note>and £50 on account of <hi rend="italic">Bleak House</hi>.<note>The first part of <hi rend="italic">Bleak House</hi> was published as vol. 230 in the “Collection of British Authors”. It was also issued in monthly parts by Tauchnitz, thus paralleling the first publication of the novel in Britain; see Böhnke, "The Correspondence", p. 317, and William B. Todd and Ann Bowden, <hi rend="italic">Tauchnitz International Editions in English 1841-1955: A Bibliographical History</hi> (New Castle, Delaware and London: Oak Knoll Press and The British Library, 1988), p. 75.</note> I also return you, herewith, the counterpart of the Agreement, signed and sealed by myself and duly attested – not by the Consul,<note>British diplomat James Colquhoun (1780-1855), chargé d’affaires for Saxony and Oldenburg, and diplomatic agent for Lubeck, Bremen and Hamburg. He became Consul-General in England representing the King of Saxony in 1827, and in 1848 was awarded the star of a Commander of the Royal Saxon Order of Civil Merit, and given the title Chevalier de Colquhoun.</note> but, I believe, in an equally legal manner.
