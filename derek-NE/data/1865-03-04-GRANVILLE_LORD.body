I have been laid up at my office in town with a frost-bitten foot<note>Contracted shortly before 21 Feb; actually inflammation of the joints, presumably gout: see <hi rend="italic">To</hi> Forster, [3 Mar 65], Pilgrim <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 11, p. 23.</note> (consequent on too much walking in snow), and received your kind note of invitation only this morning. I hasten to thank you for it, and to explain my seeming remissness. As I shall be here until June, I shall hope to have the honour and pleasure of thanking you in person for your kind remembrance.
