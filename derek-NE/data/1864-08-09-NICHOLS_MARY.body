The chapter of your Unholy Land<note>Part of the material additional to “A Trip in the Unholy Land” (><hi rend="italic"> To</hi> Mrs Nichols, 25 July 1863); this chapter renamed by CD “On the Mississippi” (><hi rend="italic"> All the Year Round</hi>, 27 Aug, XII, 58).</note> that I had before the receipt of your letter, is in type. The chapter to which you refer in your said letter,<note>The chapter most likely, but not certainly, another part of “A Trip”.</note> I have not, because it has (no doubt) gone to Mr. Wills to be entered in the regular book and way of the office. Assuming it to be at the office, I will return it to you at the end of the week. Even though we were not going to run, for some weeks, two serial stories together,<note>Compare <hi rend="italic">To</hi> Mrs Nichols, 25 July 1863. From August, <hi rend="italic">All the Year Round</hi>, XII, continued to run Sala’s <hi rend="italic">Quite Alone</hi> and began <hi rend="italic">Percy Fitzgerald’s Never Forgotten</hi>.</note> I should still be indisposed to proceed with this series:- for the reason that I believe your countrymen are not now in the mood to be told anything from this side of the water concerning themselves,<note>i.e. during the Civil War.</note> and that they would unconsciously misrepresent the intention, and that we should do more [than]<note>Crossed out by CD.</note> harm than good.
